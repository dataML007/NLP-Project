Post infection, the ssRNA encodes two open reading frames, produced through host ribosomal frameshifting that transcribes two polyprotein products. The polyprotein products are subsequently cleaved into 27 viral proteins by internally encoded proteases. Further processing of the polyprotein releases an RNA-polymerase along with several non-structural proteins that facilitate RNA synthesis and may play a role in the enveloping process but are not included in the viral coat. Treatment of infections caused by betacoronoaviruses have focused on three therapeutic strategies; vaccination with the spike glycoprotein of the SARS-Cov-2 envelope (Wrapp et al., 2020) , and small-molecule targeting of conserved viral enzymes (e.g. the Mpro protease (Zhenming et al. 2020 ) (Yang et al., 2005) and the RNApolymerase (Yan et al. 2020) . Nevertheless, some of the betacoronaviral non-structural proteins appear important for viral replication within SARS-CoV and influence pathogenesis (Frieman et al., 2012) . Despite their close homology between viruses, such non-structural proteins remain of interest as they may have conserved roles within the viral lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2. During infection of human cells, SARS-CoV Non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9SARS) was found to be important for replication (Frieman et al., 2012) . Homologs of the Nsp9 protein have been identified in numerous coronaviruses including SARS-Cov-2 (Nsp9COV19), human coronavirus 229E (Nsp9HcoV), avian infectious bronchitis virus (Nsp9IBV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (Nsp9PEDV) and porcine delta virus (Nsp9PDCoV). Nsp9SARS has been shown to have modest affinity for long oligonucleotides with binding thought to be dependent on oligomerisation state (Egloff et al., 2004) (Sutton et al., 2004) . Nsp9SARS dimerises in solution via a conserved a-helical 'GxxxG' motif. Disruption of key residues within this motif reduces both RNA-binding (Sutton et al., 2004) and SARS-CoV viral proliferation (Frieman et al., 2012) . The mechanism of RNA binding within the Nsp9 protein family is not understood as these proteins have an unusual structural fold not previously seen in RNA binding proteins (Egloff et al., 2004) (Sutton et al., 2004) . The fold's Greek-key motif exhibits topological similarities with OB-fold proteins and small protein B but such vestiges have proven insufficient to provide clear insight into Nsp9 function (Egloff et al., 2004) . As a consequence of the weak affinity of Nsp9SARS for long oligonucleotide stretches it was suggested that the natural RNA substrate may instead be conserved features at the 3' end of the viral-genome (the stem-loop II RNA-motif) (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . Furthermore, potential direct interactions with the co-factors of the RNA polymerase have been reported . However, it remains to be determined how the oligonucleotide-binding activity of Nsp9 proteins promote viral replication during infection. The sequence of Nsp9 homologues are conserved amongst betacoronoaviruses, yet there remains the potential for functional differences in different viruses. Nsp9COV19 exhibits 97% sequence identity with Nsp9SARS but only 44% sequence identity with Nsp9HCoV. The structure of the HCoV-229E Nsp9 protein suggested a potential oligomeric switch induced upon the formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond. Here, disulfide bond formation shifts the relative orientation of the Nsp9 monomers, which was suggested to promote higher-order oligomerisation (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . The resultant rod-like higher order Nsp9HCoV assemblies had increased affinity for the RNA oligonucleotides. Cysteine mutants of Nsp9HCoV that are unable to produce the disulfide displayed reduced RNA-binding affinity (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . The observation of a redox-induced structural switch of Nsp9HCoV led to the hypothesis that Nsp9HCoV may have a functional role in sensing the redox status of the host cell (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . While the \\\"redox-switch\\\" cysteine responsible for oligomer formation in Nsp9HCoV is conserved amongst different viral Nsp9 homologues the higher-order oligomers were not observed for Nsp9SARS (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . Because of these potential differences between Nsp9 proteins we sought to further characterise the nature of Nsp9COV19. The Nsp9 protein from SARS-CoV-2 (Nsp9COV19) was cloned and recombinantly expressed in E. coli. The expression construct included an N-terminal Hexa-His tag attached via a rhinoviral 3Cprotease site. Following Ni-affinity chromatography Nsp9COV19 was further purified via size-exclusion chromatography to yield > 95% pure and homogeneous protein. Nsp9COV19 eluted from gel filtration columns with the apparent molecular weight of a dimer suggesting that, as with other Nsp9 proteins, Nsp9COV19 is an obligate homodimer. The Nterminal tag was removed prior to any biochemical experiments via overnight digestion with precision protease, as reported for Nsp9SARS (Sutton et al., 2004) . The affinity of viral Nsp9 homologues for oligonucleotides has a range of binding affinities reported, some of which are dependent on oligomerisation state and nucleotide length, ranging from 20-400 \\u03bcM (Zeng et al., 2018) . We therefore sought to assess the potential for Nsp9COV19 to bind to fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides using fluorescence anisotropy. Preliminary experiments were performed under conditions similar to those previously identified for Nsp9SARS (Sutton et al., 2004) . Oligonucleotide affinity was very limited under our assay conditions (Fig. 1) . Indeed, protein concentrations up to 200 \\u00b5M of Nsp9COV19 did not result in saturated binding and thus indicated an incredibly low affinity KD, or no affinity for these oligonucleotides at all under these assay conditions. We next determined the structure of apo-Nsp9COV19 (Table 1 ). The apo-Nsp9COV19 structure aligned closely to that of Nsp9SARS (R.M.S.D of 0.57\\u00c5 over 113 C\\u03b1, Fig. 2A -C) (Egloff et al., 2004) . Like other Nsp9 homologues it exhibits an unusual fold that is yet to be observed outside of coronaviruses (Sutton et al., 2004) . The core of the fold is a small 6-stranded enclosed \\u03b2-barrel, from which a series of extended loops project outward (Fig 2A) . The elongated loops link the individual \\u03b2-strands of the barrel, along with a projecting N-terminal \\u03b2strand and C-terminal \\u03b11-helix; the latter two elements make up the main Fluorescence polarization anisotropy assays were used to examine the possibility that Nsp9COV19 could bind to labelled 17-mer and 10-mer single stranded oligonucleotides.

Two loops project from the open-face of the barrel: the \\u03b22-3-and \\u03b23-4-loops are both positively charged, glycine rich, and are proposed to be involved in RNA-binding. The only protrusion on the enclosed barrel-side is the \\u03b26-7-loop; the Cterminal half of the \\u03b27-strand is an integral part of the fold's barrel-core but its other half extended outward to pair with the external \\u03b26-strand and create a twisted \\u03b2-hairpin, cupping the \\u03b11-helix and interacting with subsequent C-terminal residues. The arrangement of monomers within Nsp9-dimers is wellconserved in different viruses and is maintained within Nsp9COV19 (R.M.S.D of 0.66\\u00c5 over 226C\\u03b1 compared to the dimeric unit of Nsp9SARS). The main component of the intersubunit interaction is the self-association of the conserved GxxxG protein-protein binding motif (Fig. 3C ) that allowed backbone van der Waals interactions between interfacing copies of the C-terminal \\u03b11-helix (Hu et al. 2017) . Here Gly-100 of the respective parallel \\u03b11-helices, formed complementary backbone van der Waals interactions. These interactions were replicated after a full helical turn by Gly-104 of the respective chains, thereby forming the molecular basis of the Nsp9COVID19 dimer interface (Fig. 3C) . The 2-fold axis that created the dimer ran at a ~15 \\u00b0 angle through the GxxxG motif allowing the 14-residue helix to cross its counterpart (Fig.   4A ), the N-terminal turns of the helix were relatively isolated, only making contacts with counterpart protomer residues. In contrast, the Cterminal portions were encircled by hydrophobic residues, albeit at a distance that created funnel-like hydrophobic cavities either side of the interfacing helices (Fig. 3A) . Strands \\u03b21, \\u03b26 and the protein's C-terminus served to provide a ring of residues that encircled the paired helices. The first 10 residues of Nsp9COV19 exchanged across the dimer-interface to form a strand-like extension of \\u03b21 that ran alongside \\u03b26 from the other protomer (Fig. 3A) . The interaction these strands made did not appear optimal, indeed the remaining four C-terminal residues projected sideways across the dimer interface, inserting between the two strands while contributing a hydrophobic backing to the main helix. In a separate crystallisation experiment we determined the structure of Nsp9COV19 that included the N-terminal tag together with a rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (termed 3C-Nsp9COV19). The 3C-Nsp9COV19 crystal form diffracted to 2.05 \\u00c5 resolution in space group P4322, and had 1 molecule within the asymmetric unit, with the dimer being created across the crystallographic 2-fold axis. Unexpectedly the high-resolution structure of 3C-Nsp9COV19 diverged from that of the apo-Nsp9COV19 (R.M.S.D 0.86 \\u00c5 for the monomer and 2.23 \\u00c5 when superimposing a dimer). The 3C sequence folded-around either side of the paired intersubunit helices to fill two funnel-like hydrophobic cavities (Fig. 2D, 3B, 4C, D) . Namely, 3C residues LEVL, inserted into the opposing cavities either side of the dimer interface and ran parallel to the paired GxxxG motif. Moreover, the 3C sequence formed additional \\u03b2-sheet interactions with the Nterminus of the protein from the other protomer (Fig. 3B) . To accommodate the 3C residues the N-terminal strand residues moved outward by ~1.6 \\u00c5 (residues 6-10). This movement allowed the Nterminus to increase the number of \\u03b2-sheet interactions it formed with \\u03b26'. The \\u03b2-barrel core of the fold remained unchanged but the increase in interactions between \\u03b21 and \\u03b26' served to exclude the C-terminus, prompting residues 106-111 to condense into a bent extension of the ahelix (Fig. 4A, B) . The subtle structural changes near the interacting GxxxG motifs (Fig. 3D ) are amplified at the periphery of the dimer resulting in ~ 6 \\u00c5 shift in the \\u03b2-barrel core (Fig. 4C)  When comparing apo-Nsp9COV19 with 3C-Nsp9COV19 the point where the N-terminal interface strand diverges is near Leu-9 (Fig. 3D) . Within the apo form it makes van der Waals interactions with the sidechains of Met-101, Asn-33 and Ser-105; this latter serine is important as it immediately follows the conserved protein-binding motif ( 100 GMVLGS 105 ), while also specifically interacting with Gly104' from the opposing protomer. Within the 3C-Nsp9COV19 structure the extraneous LEVL residues insert at this point (Fig. 5B) , the hydrophobic side chains clasp either side of Ser-105 and allowed its hydroxyl group to form backbone hydrogen bonds to the glutamate within the extraneous sequence (Fig. 5B) . Meanwhile the C-terminal Leucine from the extraneous residues inserted behind the a-helix of the other protomer (Fig. 5B ). Cumulatively these changes allow for a ~5\\u00b0 rotation of the protomer subunits about the 2-fold axis compared to apo-Nsp9COV19 (Fig.  4C ). Most residues involved in protein-binding within the hydrophobic cavity and the structural changes needed to accommodate them appear broadly conserved amongst other Nsp9 viral homologues (red highlights in Fig. 5A ). The main exception to this is Ser-105, which A side-view of the N-and C-terminal structural elements at the dimer interface are shown for the a) apo-and b) peptide-occupied forms. c) Overlay of the Nsp9COV19 dimer in the apo and peptide-bound forms indicating respective shifts in subunit orientation.

However, the N-terminal interface \\u03b2-strand in these homologues is known to be involved in interface re-organisation of the subunits (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) and thus denotes other structural differences at this site. Here we describe the structure of the recombinantly expressed Nsp9COV19 as part of a global effort to characterise the virus causing a current global pandemic. Nsp9 is important for virulence in SARS-CoV (Miknis et al., 2009) . It remains to be understood whether Nsp9COV19 plays a similar role in SARS-CoV-2, however the 97 % sequence identity suggests a high degree of functional conservation. The CoV Nsp9 proteins are seemingly obligate dimers comprising a unique fold that associates via an unusual a-helical GxxxG interaction motif. The integrity of this motif is considered important for viral replication (Miknis et al., 2009 ), leading to a proposal that disruption of the unusual dimer interface impacts on RNA binding and function (Hu et al., 2017) . Mutation of the same interaction motif in the porcine delta coronavirus Nsp9PDCoV also disrupted nucleotide binding capacity (Zeng et al., 2018) . We describe the ability to produce homogenous Nsp9COV19 which purifies as an obligate dimer, consistent with other Nsp9 proteins. Our preliminary nucleotide binding assays brought into question the RNA binding capacity of Nsp9COV19. The structure of the Nsp9COV19 showed conservation of the unique Nsp9 fold when compared with homologues from SARS (Egloff et al., 2004) (Sutton et al., 2004) . Indeed, the topological fold was conserved as was the Nsp9 specific ahelical GxxxG dimerisation interface. This a-helical interface is encircled by hydrophobic residues but the interface includes considerable cavities as observed previously (Egloff et al., 2004) . We made a serendipitous discovery in our 3C-Nsp9COV19 structure, whereby the hydrophobic cavity captured the 3C cleavage sequence LEVL. The extraneous residues were tightly bound on all sides within the site situating themselves proximal to the conserved GxxxG motif. Coordination of the 3C sequence induced changes within interfacing residues, serving to both restructure key structural elements and cause a modest shift in subunit orientation. At this stage it is unclear whether the bound residues within our structure have any bearing on the physiological function of Nsp9COV19. In the first instance this would seem unlikely, however our sequence is that of a rhinoviral 3C protease site and the SARS-CoV main protease cleaves consensus sequences following an LQ sequence (Zhu et al., 2011) . The bound 3C-LE residues have hallmarks of the LQ motif and are proximal to the highly conserved GxxxG motif. There are no obvious structural features to preclude, or select for, a Glu to Gln substitution within our . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Notably the M pro cleavage sequence occurs at multiple points throughout the CoV genome as the majority of viral proteins are released by its activity, thus it remains possible that Nsp9 may associate with unprocessed viral polyproteins retaining them near the viral RNA. Within our structure Met-101 provides contacts with the bound valine sidechain but the presence of Asn-33 nearby may also accommodate residues such as lysine at this position. Peptide-binding assays will need to be developed to rigorously assess such possibilities. In summary we have established a protocol for the production and purification of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 protein. We determined the structure of the Nsp9COV19 and described the conservation of the unique fold and dimerisation interface identified previously for members of this protein family. We also determined structure of Nsp9COV19 in complex with a 3C sequence, although the significance of this is yet to be established. The structures we describe here could potentially be utilised in drug screening and targeting experiments to disrupt a dimer interface known to be important for coronavirus replication. Synthetic cDNA for the Nsp9COV19 protein was cloned into pET28-LIC expression vector bearing an N-terminal His-tag with a Rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site (MAHHHHHHSAALEVLFQGPG). The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells which were grown in Luria Broth at 37\\u00b0C until reaching an Absorbance at 600nm of ~1.0 before being induced with 0.5mM Isopropyl \\u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 hours. Cells were harvested in 20mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150mM NaCl, 20mM Imidazole, 2mM MgCl2 and 0.5mM TCEP and frozen until required. Lysis was achieved by sonicating the cells in the presence of 1mg of Lysozyme and 1mg of DNAase on ice. The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000xg for 20 minutes and loaded onto a nickel affinity column. Bound protein was washed extensively with 20 column volumes of 20mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150mM NaCl, 0.5mM TCEP before being eluted in the same buffer with the addition of 400mM Imidazole. For His-tag removal samples were incubated with precision 3c protease overnight at 4\\u00b0C. All samples were subjected to gel filtration (S75 16/60; GE Healthcare) in 20mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150mM NaCl before being concentrated to 50mg/mL for crystallization trials. Nsp9COV19 crystallized in 2.0-2.2M NH4SO4 and 0.1M Phosphate-citrate buffer pH 4.0. Crystals of the His-tag samples grew with rectangular morphology in space group P4122, however if the Histag was removed the crystals grew in space group P6122 form with hexagonal morphology. All diffraction data were collected at the Australian synchrotron's MX2 beamline at the Australian synchrotron ) (see Table 1 for details). Data were integrated in XDS (Kabsch, 2010) , processed with SCALA, phases were obtained through molecular replacement using PDB 1QZ8 (Egloff et al., 2004 ) as a search model. Subsequent rounds of manual building and refinement were performed in Coot and PHENIX (Liebschner et al., 2019) . To examine the RNA-binding affinity, an 18-point serial dilution (212-0 \\u00b5M) of Nsp9COV19 was incubated with 1 nM 5'-Fluorescein labelled 17mer poly-U single-stranded RNA (Dharmacon GE, USA) or 10mer PolyT single-stranded DNA (IDT, USA) in assay buffer (20mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150mM NaCl, 2mM MgCl2) at room temperature. The assay was performed in 96-well non-binding black plates (Greiner Bio-One), with fluorescence anisotropy measured in triplicate using the PHERAstar FS (BMG) with FP 488-520-520 nm filters. The data was corrected using the anisotropy of RNA sample alone, then fitted by a one-site binding model using the Equation, A = (Amax [L])/(KD+[L]), where A is the corrected fluorescence anisotropy; Amax is maximum binding fluorescence anisotropy signal, [L] is the Nsp9COV19 concentration, and KD is the dissociation equilibrium constant. Amax and KD were used as fitting parameters and nonlinear regression was performed using GraphPad Prism. Measurements were taken after 60 minutes incubation between protein and RNA.

Since Jan 23, 2020, the Chinese government has put Wuhan and several nearby cities under quarantine, hoping to stop the disease from spreading to other parts of the country. However, millions of people had left Wuhan before the lockdown because of the approaching Spring Festival holiday. Containment measures in the COVID-19 outbreak have focused on identifying, treating, and isolating infected people, tracing and quarantining their close contacts, and promoting precautionary behaviors among the general public. Therefore, the psychological and behavioral responses of the general population play an important role in the control of the outbreak. Previous studies have explored on this topic in various culture settings with SARS, 4, 5, 6 pandemic influenza A(H1N1), 7, 8, 9, 10 and influenza A(H7N9). 11, 12, 13 Cultural differences are evident in public responses. 14, 15 Behavioral changes are also associated with government involvement level, perceptions of diseases, and the stage of the outbreak, and these factors vary by diseases and settings. 4, 5, 8, 16 The current COVID-19 outbreak provides a unique platform to study behavioral changes for two main reasons. First, government engagement in the control of the outbreak has been unprecedented, for example, locking down Wuhan and surrounding cities, building new hospitals to treat infected patients in Wuhan within two weeks, extending holidays and school closure, deploying thousands of medical staff to heavily affected areas, and running intense public messaging campaigns. Second, the public are faced with rather mixed information, partly because knowledge of the newly emerging disease is evolving with the course of the outbreak. For example, the national technical protocols for COVID-19 released by the National Health Commission have been updated five times within a month. Both features might result in different public responses towards the outbreak. In this study, we aimed to investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of COVID-19 outbreak and to examine public perceptions associated with the response outcomes in mainland China. A population-based telephone interview was carried out between 1 and 10 February, 2020. The cities of Wuhan and Shanghai were selected to represent diverse exposure intensities to the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Wuhan is the hardest-hit city to date, the city where the virus originated, and the earliest city put under quarantine. By contrast, Shanghai is one of the largest cities in China, and was estimated to have received the largest number of infected travelers from Wuhan. 17, 18 Before our survey, Wuhan confirmed 3,215 cases, 19 accounting for 27.3% of all cases across China; 20 Shanghai reported 153 cases, 68 (44.4%) of them from nonlocal residents. 21 Figure 1 illustrates the timeline of the outbreak progression compared with our survey dates. The survey was conducted by well-trained interviewers with 1,011 residents of Wuhan (n=510) and Shanghai (n=501) using a computerized random digital dialing system. The sample size provided us with a sample error of 5%. Proportional quota sampling based on age and sex was used to ensure a demographically representative sample of the general population in each city. Calls were placed three times at different hours on the same day before being classified as invalid. Local residents who were aged 18 years and above and were currently living in the selected cities were eligible to participate. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants. Figure S1 presents the flow chart of participant recruitment. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board at School of Public Health, Fudan University (IRB#2020-TYSQ-01-1). Anxiety was assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). The tool is a brief self-reported scale that has demonstrated good reliability and validity in the general population. 22, 23 Participants were asked to answer how frequently they had been bothered by various symptoms over the past two weeks. The scale accordingly produced a summary GAD scores ranging from 0 to 21. Respondents that scored 10 and above were identified as having moderate or severe level of anxiety. 22  Participants were asked three questions about recent avoidance behaviors (avoided eating out, avoided taking public transportation, and reduced visits to public places) and another three about recommended behaviors (rescheduling travel plan, increasing surface cleaning, and maintaining better indoor ventilation) in response to the outbreak. All questions were phrased as \\\"during the past week, did you ever \\u2026 because of the novel coronavirus outbreak\\\". Possible responses for each question were yes or no. Three sets of questions were asked to collect information about preventive behaviors in usual days before 31 December 2019 when an unknown pneumonia outbreak related to the later identified SARS-CoV-2 was firstly reported, and then in the past week. The first two sets of questions regarding the frequency of wearing a face mask when going out and the frequency of handwashing immediately when returning home. Response options were never (scored as 1), rare (2), sometimes (3), usually (4), always (5), or did not go out. The top reasons for wearing a face mask in usual days and in the past week were collected. Respondents who did not always wear a face mask in the past week were also required to provide a most possible reason. The third set of question concerning handwashing duration with five responses categories from short to long (1 score to 5 scores), for less than 10 seconds, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] seconds, 20-39 seconds, 40-59 seconds, or 60 seconds and above, respectively. Respondents whose answers for behaviors in the past week scored higher than those in usual days were categorized as increased frequency or duration of the aforementioned behaviors.

Five items were used to assess whether participants believed that certain measures would reduce their risk of catching COVID-19, with possible response options being ineffective (1), even (2), or effective (3). The first three items (frequent handwashing, wearing a face mask, and avoiding going out) were consistent with the advertising campaign run by the government. The last two items (washing mouth with salty water, and taking vitamin C or a product of the traditional Chinese medicine, isatis root) were considered as misinformation by medical experts. Participants answered effective in all first three items and ineffective in both of the last two items were categorized as having correct perceived efficacy of behaviors. Four items assessed perceived threats of the novel coronavirus. Participants were asked \\\"how likely do you think you will contract novel coronavirus infection over the next month\\\" with five responses from very unlikely (1) to very likely (5), and \\\"how serious do you think the novel coronavirus infection would be if you contracted it\\\" with five options from very mild (1) to very serious (5) . Participants were also required to report relative transmissibility and severity compared with SARS in 2003 with five response categories being much lower (1), lower (2), similar (3), higher (4), or much higher (5) . Three items assessed how well informed were the public. Participants were asked \\\"whether you have received and read the information brochure about the novel coronavirus from the government and medical experts\\\" with two response options (yes or no). They were then required to provide response to the statement \\\"information that I received about the novel coronavirus outbreak is sufficient\\\" with five options from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5) . To assess the impact of mixed information during the outbreak, participants were asked to report the frequency that they felt confused or bothered about the reliability of the information that they received. Response options ranged from never (1) to always (5). All rights reserved.

Personal characteristics were collected in the following dimensions: sex, age, working status, perceived household income level, whether experienced symptoms (cough and fever) during the past two weeks, whether has friends or relatives with symptoms in the past two weeks, and whether there had been confirmed or suspected cases of novel coronavirus infections in their neighborhood. Analyses were carried out in Stata version 14 for Windows. Descriptive analysis of the aforementioned responses was performed to report the counts and frequencies, stratified by cities. Differences across cities were examined using t tests for dummy variables and Chisquare or fisher's exact tests (when applicable) for variables measured by a Likert scale. The primary outcomes were moderate or severe anxiety (GAD-7 score \\u226510), and whether respondents engaged in all recommended and avoidance behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression models were first used to estimate associations between personal characteristics and primary outcomes. These models adjusting for personal characteristics were then used to investigate associations between perception variables and primary outcomes. Perception variables were included in the form of continuous scores. Public were involved in this study as participants of the telephone survey. All rights reserved.

Of these, 7,341 calls answered; of these, 5,650 declined the participation invitation, 505 were ineligible, 185 dropped before completion, leaving 1,011 respondents successfully completed the interview. The response rate was 13.8% (1,011/7,341) ( Figure S1 ). Participants in Wuhan (34.5%) reported a much higher rate of living in neighborhood with confirmed or suspected novel coronavirus cases than those in Shanghai (6.4%) ( Table 1 ). A total of 167 (32.7%) respondents in Wuhan and 102 (20.4%) respondents in Shanghai were identified to have moderate or severe anxiety (Panel A Table 2 ). The prevalence was significantly higher in Wuhan (p<0.001). The mean GAD-7 scores were 7.1 and 5.1 in Wuhan and Shanghai, respectively (p<0.001). In total 401 (78.6%) Wuhan participants and 320 (63.9%) Shanghai participants engaged in all six recommended and avoidance behaviors due to the novel coronavirus outbreak (Panel B Table 2 ). A high compliance rate of above 90% was observed in all other behaviors in both samples, except for increased surface cleaning, which was driving the significant observed differences in behavioral responses between the two cities (Table S1 ). Frequencies of washing hands immediately when returning home, wearing a face mask when going out, and duration of handwashing significantly increased in both cities during the outbreak (Panel B Table 2 ; Figure 2 ). We found no statistically significant differences in changes of the first two aforementioned behaviors. By contrast, more respondents reported longer duration of handwashing in Wuhan (p<0.001). Moreover, a significantly higher proportion of Wuhan respondents reported purchasing or trying to purchase goggles for prevention purpose (p=0.009). Overall, 12.7% Wuhan participants responded with correct perceived efficacy of behaviors. The proportion was significantly higher (p=0.004) in the Shanghai sample (19.4%) (Panel C Table 2 ). Generally, Wuhan respondents reported significantly higher self-perceived risk (p=0.033) of contracting novel coronavirus than their counterparts in Shanghai; however, All rights reserved.

No differences were found between the two cities in terms of perceived harm to body compared with SARS. Moreover, respondents aged 40 and above, who presumably have clearer memory of SARS, had higher (p<0.001) perceived relative severity than those aged 18-39 in Shanghai; similar findings were not found in Wuhan (Table S2) . Around 96.1% Wuhan respondents had received and read the information brochures of the novel coronavirus from the government or medical experts. The proportion was significantly lower (p<0.001) but still very high in Shanghai (89.0%). The majority of the respondents in both cities thought that the information that they received was sufficient, without discernable differences. By contrast, the Wuhan respondents were significantly more often confused about the reliability of the information that they received (p=0.003); only 31% respondents in Wuhan never felt bothered about this issue, while the corresponding figure in Shanghai was 42.9%. The majority of the participants agreed or strongly agreed with having confidence on taking measures to protect themselves. We detected no statistically significant differences across cities in this domain. The largest positive and significant effects on moderate or severe anxiety were from participants with confirmed or suspected cases in their living neighborhood (odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3-2.8) ( Table 1 ). Compared to low income individuals, those with median income were less likely to suffer moderate or severe anxiety (odds ratio 0.6, 0.4-0.9). Furthermore, Shanghai participants were significantly less likely to report moderate or severe anxiety (odds ratio 0.6, 0.5-0.8) or carry out all recommended and avoidance behaviors (odds ratio 0.4, 0.3-0.6) than Wuhan participants. We found no evidence that sex, age, educational attainment, working status and marital status were closely associated with psychological and behavioral responses during the novel coronavirus outbreak.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02. 18.20024448 doi: medRxiv preprint We found that higher perceived risk and severity of contracting the novel coronavirus, higher perceived relative transmissibility and harm to body to SARS, and more confusion about information reliability were all significantly and positively associated with reported moderate or severe anxiety during the outbreak (Table 3 ). In contrast, stronger self-confidence was significantly associated with lower risks of moderate or severe anxiety. For behavioral responses, increases in anxiety levels, perceived risks and harms to body relative to SARS, and confusion about information reliability were significantly associated with higher probability of carrying out all recommended and avoidance behaviors during the outbreak (Table 3 ). For increases in frequencies of immediate handwashing behavior when returning home, the factor that exerted the largest impact was having received and read information brochures from the government, followed by having correct perceived efficacy of behaviors (Table S3 ). Higher perceived harm to body compared with SARS was the only factor with significant explanatory power for goggles purchase behavior. We found no evidence that perceptions and anxiety levels were associated with changes in frequencies of wearing face masks during the outbreak (Table S3 ). We conducted a population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing to investigate anxiety levels, changes in precautionary behaviors and public perceptions among Wuhan and Shanghai residents during the early phase of 2019 novel coronavirus. Around of 32.7% Wuhan and 20.4% Shanghai participants reported moderate or severe anxiety; 78.6% Wuhan and 63.9% Shanghai respondents carried out all six precautionary behaviors due to the outbreak. Wuhan residents were significantly more responsive than their Shanghai counterparts in the two aforementioned outcomes. Our results suggested that perceived risk and severity of the disease as well as information reliability were important factors associated with the psychological and behavioral responses.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is Second, our results suggest that more responsive behavioral changes observed in this study were associated with the strong involvement from the Chinese government during the control and prevention of coronavirus than voluntary avoidance behaviors reported previously. 5,9,26,27, Measures such as temporary closing down public transportation in Wuhan and imposing punishment for passengers not wearing a face mask on metro in Shanghai have fueled the high compliance rates with government recommendations (Table S1 ) and perceived efficacy of these behaviors (Table S4 ). These polices are also responsible for the limited observed heterogeneity in uptake and changes of precautionary behaviors. For example, we find that no perception variables exerted a statistically meaningful effect on increased face mask wearing frequency (Table S3) . Third, we provided evidence for unwarranted precautionary behavior in coping with a novel disease, which was less documented in the literature. 5 Around 28% Wuhan and 21% Shanghai respondents reported having purchased or having tried to purchase goggles for infection prevention. According to the National Health Commission experts, goggles are unnecessary protective equipment for people other than medical staff on the front line of coronavirus outbreak. However, goggles were sold out nationwide shortly after a doctor wrote on social media and suspected that lack of eye protection in early investigation of the outbreak All rights reserved.

Our results showed that the irrational behavior was mainly driven by perceived higher severity than SARS and the over-reaction was more prevalent in Wuhan (Table S3) . Fourth, perceived susceptibility and severity of the coronavirus were higher compared with studies regarding other diseases. After translating our results into comparable scales, we found that the perceived chance of infection (12.5-18.6%) was higher than that during H7N9 in urban China (1.0-2.6%), 11 and SARS in Hong Kong (3.9-14.3%); 4 and the relative severity to SARS was four times higher than that of H7N9 in urban China (8.9-11.4%). 11 Though higher perceived risk and harm of coronavirus positively associated with favorable responses in behaviors, it also led to significantly higher anxiety levels among the general public. Our findings also yield several important public implications. First, providing the public with reliable and accurate information is crucial for addressing the psychological effects of contagious disease outbreaks. Public confusion about the reliability of information that they received might have led to significantly sustained anxiety. About 57.1-69.0% individuals were ever bothered by this issue, and the prevalence of this issue was significantly more common among people subject to quarantine in Wuhan, suggesting stronger desire for facts. 28 Second, consequences of misinformation could be long-lasting and should not be underestimated in health crisis management. 7, 29 Although efficacy of behaviors supported in advertising campaign was well received, rumors that have been proved wrong earlier during the SARS outbreak, for example, washing mouth with salty water, or having vitamin C or radix isatidis, still found their audience. Only 24.6-37.9% respondents in our study correctly considered these measures as ineffective (Table S4) ; the correct rate was significantly lower in Wuhan. Finally, awareness of hand hygiene in China has been low, which calls for more handwashing education in the community. We found that the proportion of handwashing duration over 40 seconds as recommended by WHO only slightly increased from 17.3% to 37.6% during novel coronavirus outbreak. 30 Fortunately, having received and read information brochures was positively associated with longer handwashing duration (Table S3) , suggesting education programs will be effective for addressing this issue.

First, in order to investigate public response rates in the immediate aftermath of the major public health crisis, we shortened our survey questionnaire and chose to use random digital dialing with quota sampling to obtain demographically representative samples for both selected cities. We deliberately selected out times of handwashing as a key behavior measure, although it is widely discussed in the literature. Because people have largely reduced going out during the extended national holidays while embracing remote work, resulting in less times of handwashing than in usual days, which makes this measure less valid. Second, we asked respondents to recall some of their behaviors in usual days before December 2019. Their answers might suffer recall bias. In conclusion, it is seen that psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 had been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. Prevalence of moderate or severe anxiety were 4-5 times of its normal level in urban China. The majority engaged in all six recommended and avoidance behaviors. Wuhan, the epicentre and quarantined city, was significantly more responsive in the aforementioned domains than Shanghai. Tremendous government efforts in control and prevention of the disease were associated with sizable changes in face mask wearing. However, confusion about information reliability significantly fueled the public anxiety levels, and public awareness of hand hygiene was less optimal. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information and to focus more on handwashing education. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

As the recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses have shown, the risks posed even by these previously known agents remain unpredictable and their expansion hard to control (Calvignac-Spencer et al., 2014) . What is more, it is almost certain that more unknown pathogen species and strains are yet to be discovered, given their constant, extremely fast-paced evolution and unexplored biodiversity, as well as increasing human exposure (Vouga & Greub, 2016; Trappe et al., 2016) . Some of those novel pathogens may cause epidemics (similar to the SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks in 2002 and 2012) or even pandemics (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 and the \\\"swine flu\\\" H1N1/09 strain). Many have more than one host or vector, which makes assessing and predicting the risks even more difficult. For example, Ebola has its natural reservoir most likely in fruit bats (Leendertz et al., 2016) , but causes deadly epidemics in both humans and chimpanzees. As the state-of-the art approach for the open-view detection of pathogens is genome sequencing (Lecuit & Eloit, 2014; Calistri & Pal\\u00f9, 2015) , it is crucial to develop automated pipelines for characterizing the infectious potential of currently unidentifiable sequences. Screening against potentially dangerous subsequences before their synthesis may also be used as a way of ensuring responsible research in synthetic biology. While potentially useful in some applications, engineering of viral genomes could also pose a biosecurity and biosafety threat. Two controversial studies modified the influenza A/H5N1 (\\\"bird flu\\\") virus to be airborne transmissible in mammals (Herfst et al., 2012; Imai et al., 2012) . A possibility of modifying coronaviruses to enhance their virulence triggered calls for a moratorium on this kind of research (Lipsitch & Inglesby, 2014) . Synthesis of an infectious horsepox virus closely related to the smallpox-causing Variola virus (Noyce et al., 2018) caused a public uproar and calls for intensified discussion on risk control in synthetic biology (Thiel, 2018) . Several computational, genome-based methods exist that allow to predict the host-range of a bacteriophage (a bacteriainfecting virus). A selection of composition-based and alignment-based approaches has been presented in an extensive review by Edwards et al. (2016) . Prediction of eukariotic host tropism (including humans) based on known protein sequences was shown for the influenza A virus (Eng et al., 2014) . Two recent studies employ k-mer based, k-NN classifiers and deep learning (Mock et al., 2019) to predict host range for a small set of three well-studied species directly from viral sequences. While those approaches are limited to those particular species and do not scale to viral host-range prediction in general, the Host Taxon Predictor (HTP) (Ga\\u0142an et al., 2019) uses logistic regression and support vector machines to predict if a novel virus infects bacteria, plants, vertebrates or arthropods. Yet, the authors argue that it is not possible to use HTP in a read-based manner; it requires long sequences of at least 3,000 nucleotides. This is incompatible with modern metagenomic next-generation sequencing workflows, where the DNA reads obtained are at least 10-20 times shorter. Another study used gradient boosting machines to predict reservoir hosts and transmission via arthropod vectors for known human-infecting viruses (Babayan et al., 2018) . Zhang et al. (2019) designed several classifiers explicitly predicting whether a new virus can potentially infect humans. Their best model, a k-NN classifier, uses k-mer frequencies as features representing the query sequence and can yield predictions for sequences as short as 500 base pairs (bp). It worked also with 150bp-long reads from real DNA sequencing runs, although in this case the reads originated also from the viruses present in the training set (and were therefore not \\\"novel\\\"). While DNA sequences mapped to a reference genome may be represented as images (Poplin et al., 2018) , a majority of studies uses a distributed orthographic representation, where each nucleotide {A, C, G, T } in a sequence is represented by a one-hot encoded vector of length 4. An \\\"unknown\\\" nucleotide (N ) can be represented as an all-zero vector. CNNs and LSTMs have been successfully used for a variety of DNA-based prediction tasks. Early works focused mainly on regulation of gene expression in humans (Alipanahi et al., 2015; Zhou & Troyanskaya, 2015; Zeng et al., 2016; Quang & Xie, 2016; Kelley et al., 2016) , which is still an area of active research (Greenside et al., 2018; Nair et al., 2019; Avsec et al., 2019) . In the field of pathogen genomics, deep learning models trained directly on DNA sequences were developed to predict host ranges of three multi-host viral species (Mock et al., 2019) and to predict pathogenic potentials of novel bacteria (Bartoszewicz et al., 2019) . DeepVirFinder (Ren et al., 2018) and ViraMiner (Tampuu et al., 2019) can detect viral sequences in metagenomic samples, but they cannot predict the host and focus on previously known species. For a broader view on deep learning in genomics we refer to a recent review by Eraslan et al. (2019) . Interpretability and explainability of deep learning models for genomics is crucial for their wide-spread adoption, as it is necessary for delivering trustworthy and actionable results. Convolutional filters can be visualized by forward-passing multiple sequences through the network and extracting the most-activating subsequences (Alipanahi et al., 2015) to create a position weight matrix (PWM) which can be visualized as a sequence logo (Schneider & Stephens, 1990; Crooks et al., 2004) . Direct optimization of input sequences is problematic, as it results in generating a dense matrix even though the input sequences are one-hot encoded (Lanchantin et al., 2016; . This problem can be alleviated with Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2016; Jha et al., 2019) or DeepLIFT, which propagates activation differences relative to a selected reference back to the input, reducing the computational overhead of obtaining accurate gradients (Shrikumar et al., 2019a) . If a reference of all-zeros is used, the method is analogous to Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (Bach et al., 2015) . DeepLIFT is an additive feature attribution method, and may used to approximate Shapley values if the input features are independent (Lundberg & Lee, 2017) . TF-MoDISco (Shrikumar et al., 2019b) uses DeepLIFT to discover consolidated, biologically meaningful DNA motifs (transcription factor binding sites). In this paper, we first improve the performance of read-based predictions of the viral host (human or non-human) from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that reversecomplement (RC) neural networks (Bartoszewicz et al., 2019) significantly outperform both the previous state-ofthe-art (Zhang et al., 2019) and the traditional, alignmentbased algorithm -BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) , which constitutes a gold standard in homology-based bioinformatics analyses. We show that defining the negative (nonhuman) class is non-trivial and compare different ways of constructing the training set. Strikingly, a model trained to distinguish between viruses infecting humans and viruses infecting other chordates (a phylum of animals including vertebrates) generalizes well to evolutionarily distant nonhuman hosts, including even bacteria. This suggests that the host-related signal is strong and the learned decision boundary separates human viruses from other DNA sequences surprisingly well. Next, we propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization using partial Shapley values to differentiate between simple nucleotide information content and the contribution of each sequence position to the final classification score. To test the biological plausibility of our models, we generate genome-wide maps of \\\"infectious potential\\\" and nucleotide contributions. We show that those maps can be used to visualize and detect virulence-related regions of interest (e.g. genes) in novel genomes. Finally, we analyze a recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which caused a pandemic in 2020 (Wu et al., 2020) . We accessed the Virus-Host Database (Mihara et al., 2016) on July 31, 2019 and downloaded all the available data. The original dataset contained 14,380 records comprising Ref-Seq IDs for viral sequences and associated metadata. Some viruses are divided into discontiguous segments, which are represented as separate records in VHDB; in those cases the segments were treated as contigs of a single genome in the further analysis. We removed records with unspecified host information and those confusing the highly pathogenic Variola virus with a similarly named genus of fish. Further, we filtered out viroids and satellites. Human-infecting viruses were extracted by searching for records containing \\\"Homo sapiens\\\" in the \\\"host name\\\" field. Note that VHDB contains information about multiple possible hosts for a given virus where appropriate. Any virus infecting humans was assigned to the positive class, also if other, non-human hosts exist. In total, the dataset contained 9,496 viruses, including 1,309 human viruses. We considered both DNA and RNA viruses; RNA sequences were encoded in the DNA alphabet, as in RefSeq. While defining a human-infecting class is relatively straightforward, the reference negative class may be conceptualized in a variety of ways. The broadest definition takes all non-human viruses into account, including bacteriophages (bacterial viruses). This is especially important, as most of known bacteriophages are DNA viruses, while many important human (and animal) viruses are RNA viruses. One could expect that the multitude of available bacteriophage genomes dominating the negative class could lower the prediction performance on viruses similar to those infecting humans. This offers an open-view approach covering a wider part of the sequence space, but may lead to misclassification of potentially dangerous mammalian or avian viruses. As they are often involved in clinically relevant host-switching events, a stricter approach must also be considered. In this case, the negative class comprises only viruses infecting Chordata (a group containing vertebrates and closely related taxa). Two intermediate approaches consider all eukaryotic viruses (including plant and fungi viruses), or only animal-infecting viruses. This amounts to four nested host sets: \\\"All\\\" (8,187 non-human viruses), \\\"Eukaryota\\\" (5,114 viruses), \\\"Metazoa\\\" (2,942 viruses) and \\\"Chordata\\\" (2,078 viruses). Auxiliary sets containing only non-eukaryotic viruses (\\\"non-Eukaryota\\\"), non-animal eukaryotic viruses (\\\"non-Metazoa Eukaryota\\\") etc. can be easily constructed by set subtraction. For the positive class, we generated a training set containing 80% of the genomes, and validation and test sets with 10% of the genomes each. Importantly, the nested structure was kept also during the training-validation-test split: for example, the species assigned to the smallest test set (\\\"Chordata\\\") were also present in all the bigger test sets. The same applied to other taxonomic levels, as well as the training and validation sets wherever applicable. We simulated 250bp long Illumina reads following a modification of a previously described protocol (Bartoszewicz et al., 2019) and using the Mason read simulator (Holtgrewe, 2010). First, we only generated the reads from the genomes of human-infecting viruses. Then, the same steps were applied to each of the four negative class sets. Finally, we also generated a fifth set, \\\"Stratified\\\", containing an equal number of reads drawn from genomes of the following disjunct host classes: \\\"Chordata\\\" (25%), \\\"non-Chordata Metazoa\\\" (25%), \\\"non-Metazoa Eukaryota\\\" (25%) and \\\"non-Eukaryota\\\" (25%). In each of the evaluated settings, we used a total of 20 million (80%) reads for training, 2.5 million (10%) reads for validation and 2.5 million (10%) paired reads as the heldout test set. Read number per genome was proportional to genome length, keeping the coverage uniform on average. While the original datasets are heavily imbalanced, we generated the same number of negative and positive data points (reads) regardless of the negative class definition used. This protocol allowed us to test the impact of defining the negative class, while using the exactly same data as representatives of the positive class. We used three training and validation sets (\\\"All\\\", \\\"Stratified\\\", and \\\"Chordata\\\"), representing the fully open-view setting, a setting more balanced with regard to the host taxonomy, and a setting focused on cases most likely to be clinically relevant. In each setting, the validation set matched the composition of the training set. The evaluation was performed using all five test sets to gain a more detailed insight on the effects of negative class definition on the prediction performance. Similarily to Zhang et al. (2019) , we used the human blood DNA virome dataset (Moustafa et al., 2017) to test the selected classifiers on real data. We obtained 14,242,329 reads of 150bp and searched all of VHDB using blastn (with default parameters) to obtain high-quality reference labels. If a read's best hit was a human-infecting virus, we assigned it to a positive class; the negative class was assigned if this was not the case. This procedure yielded 14,012,665 \\\"positive\\\" and 229,664 \\\"negative\\\" reads. . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Here, we employ a CNN with two convolutional layers with 512 filters of size 15 each, average pooling and 2 fully connected layers with 256 units each. The LSTM used has 384 units. We use dropout regularization in both cases, together with aggressive input dropout at the rate of 0.2 or 0.25 (tuned for each model). Input dropout may be interpreted as a special case of noise injection, where a fraction of input nucleotides is turned to N s. Representations of forward and reverse-complement strands are summed before the fully connected layers. As two mates in a read pair should originate from the same virus, predictions obtained for them can be averaged for a boost in performance. If a contig or genome is available, averaging predictions for constituting reads yields a prediction for the whole sequence. We used Tesla P100 GPUs for training and an RTX 2080 Ti for visualizations. We wanted the networks to yield accurate predictions for both 250bp (our data, modelling a sequencing run of an Illumina MiSeq device) and 150bp long reads (as in the Human Blood Virome dataset). As shorter reads are padded with zeros, we expected the CNNs trained using average pooling to misclassify many of them. Therefore, we prepared a modified version of the \\\"Stratified\\\" dataset, in which the last 100bp of each read were turned to zeros, mocking a shorter sequencing run while preserving the error model. Then, we retrained the CNN which had performed best on the original dataset. Since in principle, the Human Blood Virome dataset should not contain viruses infecting non-human Chordata, a \\\"Chordata\\\"-trained classifier was not used in this setting. We compare the networks to the k-NN classifier proposed by Zhang et al. (2019) and used by them for read-based predictions. We trained the classifier on the \\\"All\\\" dataset as described by the authors, i.e. using non-overlapping, 500bplong contigs generated from the training genomes (retraining on simulated reads is computationally prohibitive). We also tested the performance of using BLAST to search against an indexed database of labeled genomes. We constructed the database from the \\\"All\\\" training set and used discontiguous megablast to achieve high inter-species sensitivity. Note that both BLAST and k-NN can yield conflicting predictions for the individual mates in a read pair. What is more, BLAST yields no prediction at all if no match is found. Therefore, similarly to Bartoszewicz et al. (2019) , we used the accept anything operator to integrate binary predictions for read pairs and genomes. At least one match is needed to predict a label, and conflicting predictions are treated as if no match was found at all. Missing predictions lower both true positive and true negative rates. In order to visualize the learned convolutional filters, we downsample a matching test set to 125,000 reads and pass it through the network. This is modelled after the method presented by Alipanahi et al. (2015) . For each filter and each input sequence, the authors extracted a subsequence leading to the highest activation, and created sequence logos from the obtained sequence sets (\\\"max-activation\\\"). We used DeepLIFT (Shrikumar et al., 2019a) to extract scoreweighted subsequences with the highest contribution score (\\\"max-contrib\\\") or all subsequences with non-zero contributions (\\\"all-contrib\\\"). Computing the latter was costly and did not yield better quality logos. We use an all-zero reference. As reads from real sequencing runs are usually not equally long, shorter reads must be padded with N s; the \\\"unknown\\\" nucleotide is also called whenever there is not enough evidence to assign any other to the raw sequencing signal. Therefore, N s are \\\"null\\\" nucleotides and are a natural candidate for the reference input. We do not consider alternative solutions based on GC content or dinucleotide shuffling, as the input reads originate from multiple different species, and the sequence composition may itself be a strong marker of both virus and host taxonomy. However, some of the training sequences contain N s themselves. It is therefore possible that a filter will learn only negative weights at a given position, even though there is no biological justification for that. This may lead to assigning only negative contributions to all four possible nucleotides at a given position if the filter's contribution is positive (and positive nucleotide contributions if the filter's contribution is negative). To solve the problem, we first normalize the weight matrices position-wise, as described by Shrikumar et al. (2019a) . Finally, we calculate average filter contributions to obtain a crude ranking of feature importance with regard to both the positive and negative class. Building sequence logos involves calculating information content (IC) of each nucleotide at each position in a prospective DNA motif. This can be then interpreted as measure of evolutionary sequence conservation. However, high IC does not necessarily imply that a given nucleotide is relevant in terms of its contribution to the classifier's output. Some sub-motifs may be present in the sequences used to build the logo, even if they do not contribute to the final prediction (or even a given filter's activation). .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 To test this hypothesis, we use partial Shapley values. Intuitively speaking, we capture the contributions of a nucleotide to the network's output, but only in the context of a given intermediate neuron of the convolutional layer. More precisely, for any given feature x i , intermediate neuron y j and the output neuron z, we aim to measure how x i contributes to z while regarding only the fraction of the total contribution of x i that influences how y j contributes to z. Using the formalism of DeepLIFT's multipliers (Shrikumar et al., 2019a) and their reinterpretation in SHAP (Lundberg & Lee, 2017) , we backpropagate the activation differences only along the paths \\\"passing through\\\" y j . In Eq. 1, we define partial multipliers \\u00b5 (yj ) xiz and express them in terms of Shapley values \\u03c6 and activation differences w.r.t. the expected activation values (reference activation). Calculating partial multipliers is equivalent to zeroing out the multipliers m y k z for all k = j before backpropagating m yj z further. We define partial Shapley values \\u03d5 (yj ) i (z, x) analogously to how Shapley values can be approximated by a product of multipliers and input differences w.r.t. the reference (Eq. 2): From the chain rule for multipliers (Shrikumar et al., 2019a) , it follows that standard multipliers are a sum over all partial multipliers for a given layer y. Therefore, Shapley values as approximated by DeepLIFT are a sum of partial Shapley values for the layer y. Once we calculate the contributions of convolutional filters for the first layer, \\u03d5 (yj ) i (z, x) for the first convolutional layer of a network with one-hot encoded inputs and an all-zero reference can be efficiently calculated using weight matrices and filter activation differences (Eq. 3-4). First, in this case we do not traverse any non-linearities and can directly use the linear rule (Shrikumar et al., 2019a) to calculate the contributions of x i to y j as a product of the weight w i and the input x i . Second, the input values may only be 0 or 1. Resulting partial contributions can be visualized along the IC of each nucleotide of a convolutional kernel. To this end, we design extended sequence logos, where each nucleotide is colored according to its contribution. Positive contributions are shown in red, negative contributions are blue, and near-zero contributions are gray. Therefore, no information is lost compared to standard sequence logos, but the relevance of individual nucleotides and the filter as a whole can be easily seen. We create genome-wide phenotype analysis (GWPA) plots to analyse which parts of a viral genome are associated with the infectious phenotype. We scramble the genome into overlapping, 250bp long subsequences (pseudo-reads) without adding any sequencing noise. For the highest resolution, we use a stride of one nucleotide. We predict the infectious potential of each pseudo-read and average the obtained values at each position of the genome. Analogously, we calculate average contributions of each nucleotide to the final prediction of the convolutional network. We visualize the resulting nucleotide-resolution maps with IGV (Thorvaldsd\\u00f3ttir et al., 2013) . For well-annotated genomes, we compile a ranking of genes (or other genomic features) sorted by the average infectious potential within a given region. In addition to that, we scan the genome with the learned filters of the first convolutional layer to find genes enriched in subsequences yielding nonzero filter activations. We use Gene Ontology to connect the identified genes of interest with their molecular functions and biological processes they are engaged in. As a proof of concept, we analyze one of the viruses randomly assigned to the test set -the Ta\\u00ef Forest ebolavirus, which has a history of host-switching and can cause a serious disease. To show that the method can also be used for other biological problems, we investigated the networks trained by Bartoszewicz et al. (2019) and their predictions on a genome of a pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The authors used this particular species to assess the performance of their method on real sequencing data. In this case, we used a stride of 125bp to generate the pseudo-reads. Finally, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which emerged in December 2019, causing a pneumonia outbreak (Wu et al., 2020) . Choosing which viruses should constitute the negative class is application dependent and influences the performance of the trained models. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.29.925354 doi: bioRxiv preprint set composition. The models trained only on human and Chordata-infecting viruses maintain similar, or even better performance when evaluated on viruses infecting a much broader host range, including bacteria. This suggests that the learned decision boundary separates human viruses from all the others surprisingly well. We hypothesize that the human host signal must be relatively strong and contained within the Chordata host signal. Dropout rate of 0.2 resulted in the highest validation accuracy for CNN Str-150 and LSTM Str . A rate of 0.25 was selected for the other models. Adding more diversity to the negative class may still boost performance on more diverse test sets, as in the case of CNN trained on the \\\"All\\\" dataset (CNN All ). This model performs a bit worse on viruses infecting hosts related to humans, but achieves higher accuracy than the \\\"Chordata\\\"-trained models and the best recall overall. Rebalancing the negative class using the \\\"Stratified\\\" dataset helps to achieve higher performance on animal viruses while maintaing high overall accuracy. The LSTMs are outperformed by the CNNs, but they can be used for shorter reads without retraining (see Sections 2.2 and 3.2). We selected LSTM All and CNN All for further evaluation. Table 2 presents the results of a benchmark using the \\\"All\\\" test set. Low performance of the k-NN classifier (Zhang et al., 2019) is caused by frequent conflicting predictions for each read in a read pair (in a single-read setting it achieves 75.5% accuracy, while our best model -87.8%). Although BLAST achieves the highest precision, it yields no predictions for over 10% of the samples. CNN All is the most sensitive and accurate (Table 3) . We benchmarked our models against the human blood virome dataset used by Zhang et al. (2019) . Our models outperform their k-NN classifier. As the positive class massively outnumbers the negative class, all models achieve over 99% precision. CNN All-150 performs best (Table. 4 ). However, the positive class is dominated by viruses which are not necessarily novel. The CNN was more accurate on training data, so we expected it to detect those viruses easily. In the Fig. 1 we present example filters, visualized as \\\"maxcontrib\\\" sequence logos based on mean partial Shapley values for each nucelotide at each position. All nucleotides of the filters with the highest (Fig. 1a) or lowest (Fig. 1b) score have relatively strong contributions in accordance with the filters' own contributions. However, we observe that sometimes, there is a \\\"conserved\\\" nucleotide which consistently appears in the activating subsequences, but the sign of its contributions is opposite to the filter's (Fig. 1c) . Those \\\"counter-contributions\\\" may arise if a nucleotide with a negative weight forms a frequent motif with others with positive weights strong enough to activate the filter. We comment on this fact in the Section 4.2. Some filters seem to learn gapped motifs resembling a codon structure (Fig. 1d) . We extracted this filter from a network predicting bacterial pathogenicity trained by Bartoszewicz et al. (2019) , but we find similar filters in our networks as well. We scanned a genome of S. aureus with this filter and discovered that the learned motif is indeed significantly enriched in coding sequences (Fisher exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction, q < 10 \\u221215 ). It is also enriched in a number of specific genes. The one with the most hits (sraP, q < 10 \\u221215 ) is associated with virulence in endovascular infection. We created a GWPA plot for the Ta\\u00ef Forest ebolavirus genome (Fig. 2a) . Most genes can be detected by finding peaks of elevated pathogenic potential score predicted by at least one of the models. Intergenic regions are characterized by lower mean scores. We ran a similar analysis of S. aureus using the built-in DeePaC models (Bartoszewicz et al., 2019) and our interpretation workflow. While a viral genome contains usually .

Indeed, out of three top-ranking genes, sarR and sspB are directly engaged in virulence, while hupB regulates expression of virulence-involved genes in many pathogens (Stojkova et al., 2019) . Fig. 2b presents a GWPA plot for the whole genome of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. We highlighted the score peaks aligning with the gene encoding the spike protein, which plays a significant role in host entry (Li, 2016) , as well as the E and N genes, which were scored the highest (apart from an unconfirmed ORF10 of just 38aa downstream of N) by the CNN and the LSTM, respectively. Fig. 2c shows the nucleotide-level contributions in a small peak within the receptor-binding domain of the S protein, crucial for recognizing the host cell. The domain location was predicted with CD-search (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2017) . While this could suggest a host adaptation, more research is needed. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art in viral host prediction directly from next-generation sequencing reads (Zhang et al., 2019) , our models drastically reduce the error rates. This holds also for novel viruses not present in the training set. In the paired read scenario, the previously described method fails, and standard, alignment-based homology testing algorithm cannot find any matches in more than 10% of the cases, resulting in relatively low accuracy. On a real human virome sample, where a main source of negative (Moustafa et al., 2017) , our method filters out non-human viruses with high specificity. In this scenario, the BLAST-derived groundtruth labels were mined using the complete database (as opposed to just a training set). In all cases, our results are only as good as the training data used; high quality labels and sequences are needed to develop trustworthy models. Ideally, sources of error should be investigated with an in-depth analysis of a model's performance on multiple genomes covering a wide selection of taxonomic units. This is especially important as the method assumes no mechanistic link between an input sequence and the phenotype of interest, and the input sequence constitutes only a small fraction of the target genome without a wider biological context. Still, it is possible to predict a label even from those small, local fragments. A similar effect was also observed for image classification with CNNs (Brendel & Bethge, 2019) . Visualizing convolutional filters may help to identify potential problems. If the input data contains N s, a ReLU network may learn only negative weights at some positions, resulting in counter-contributions for all possible nucleotides at those positions. In our case, as the filters were weight-normalized, the counter-contributions suggest that the information content and the contribution of a nucleotide are not necessarily correlated. Visualizing learned motifs by aligning the activating sequences (Alipanahi et al., 2015) would not fully . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

It seems that the assumption of nucleotide independence -which is crucial for treating DeepLIFT as a method of estimating Shapley values for input nucleotides -is broken. Indeed, k-mer distribution profiles are frequently used features for modelling DNA sequences (as shown also by the dimershuffling method of generating reference sequences proposed by Shrikumar et al. (2019a) ). However, DeepLIFT's multiple successful applications in genomics indicate that the assumption probably holds approximately. We see information content and DeepLIFT's contribution values as two complementary channels that can be jointly visualized for better interpretability and explainability of CNNs in genomics. Mapping predictions back to a target genome can be used both as a way of investigating a given model's performance and as a method of genome analysis. GWPA plots of wellannotated genomes highlight the sequences with erroneous and correct phenotype predictions at both genome and gene level, and nucleotide-resolution contribution maps help track those regions down to individual amino-acids. On the other hand, once a trusted model is developed, it can be used on newly emerging pathogens, as the SARS-CoV-2 virus briefly analyzed in this work. The methods presented here may also be applied to other biological problems outside of the field of pathogen genomics. However, experimental work and traditional sequence analysis are required to truly understand the biology behind host adaptation and distinguish true hits from false positives. We presented a new approach for predicting a host of a novel virus based on a single DNA read or a read pair, cutting the error rates in half compared to the previous state-of-the-art. For convolutional filters, we jointly visualize nucleotide contributions and information content. Finally, we use GWPA plots to gain insights into the models' behavior and analyze a recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus.

We then model the impact of flight suspensions to and from China that is being witnessed globally, while ensuring that the effective distances with and without interventions (i.e., suspensions) are comparable through normalization. The reduced flow from China results in a modified network with reduced edge weights and almost all countries see an increase in their effective distance from China ( Figure 3) , with some countries having higher increase than others. Finally, we also present an analysis comparing the difference in estimated versus reported time of arrival, with respect to the different component scores of IDVI (Figure 4) , to investigate potential factors that may explain the reporting delays. There are multiple ongoing attempts to use airline traffic data to quantify global risk posed by COVID-19. In [1] , the authors employ air travel volume obtained through IATA from ten major cities across China to rank various countries along with the IDVI to convey their vulnerability. [12] consider the task of forecasting international and domestic spread of COVID-19 and employ Official Airline Group (OAG) data for determining air traffic to various countries. [6] fit a generalized linear model for observed number of cases in various countries as a function of air traffic volume obtained from OAG data (authors refer to [12] ) to determine countries with potential risk of under-detection. [7] provide Africa-specific case-study of vulnerability and preparedness using data from Civil Aviation Administration of China. In order to determine vulnerability of nations to COVID-19, the popular metric has been IDVI [1, 7] with [7] also employing WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework to determine preparedness. For the current COVID-19 outbreak, [2] provides the relative import risk to various countries estimated using the worldwide air transportation network consisting of 4000 airports, and also an interactive visualization for arbitrary origin airports. Some key differences: (a) We use IATA data which contains passenger flow volume between origin-destination airports (including transit points) instead of OAG data (used by [3] ) which contains total number of seats available for a given segment. We believe that origin-destination flows by IATA provides a better estimate of population level exposure, and the likelihood of detecting the first case in a country (rather than at the transit airports), thus serves as a better network on which to compute effective distance (cf. Appendix A). While [1, 4, 8, 12] have used the IATA data for estimating relative risk for COVID-19 spread, this is the first work to show the relationship between the emergence times of COVID-19 using effective distance with actual arrival times for 24 countries. We provide estimated ToA for countries that have not officially reported COVID-19, and provide a way to quantify the effect of ongoing airline suspensions. IATA [5] provides comprehensive air travel data covering more than 12000 airports across the world. Given a source and destination airport, it provides the number of passengers traveling between the two airports as reported by the airlines (\\\"reported PAX\\\") and the IATA estimated (\\\"reported + estimated PAX\\\") per month. The travel details include both direct and multi-hop connections between the airports. In addition, it provides the different carriers serving the two airports, which allow for simulating airline cancellations using historical data. For this analysis, we used data from the month of February 2019. Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) [9] is a metric developed by the RAND Corporation to identify countries potentially most vulnerable to poorly controlled infectious disease outbreaks because of confluence of factors including political, economic, public health, healthcare, demographics, and disease dynamics. Arrival times are curated from the official situation reports [10] published by World Health Organization. Each country is associated with the first date of confirmed case, with China being assigned December 31st, 2019. Airline suspensions information available as on February 10th 2020, by airline and routes was obtained and curated from Bloomberg [11] and other websites 2 . We use international air traffic data from February 2019, which is the most recent data that coincides with the Lunar New Year period, known to involve a large movement of people in and out of China. As mentioned previously, IATA data provides number of passengers between two airports. We aggregate the flows out of all the airports in China to all the airports within the country of interest. We treat non-stop routes and routes with transit equivalently, since we are primarily interested in passenger volumes traveling out of China disembarking at various destination countries. In order to model the risk due to direct importation, we consider the number of passengers whose trip originated in airport m and ended in airport n (through multiple paths) as obtained from IATA database. This data extracted from IATA is different from the number of available seats between m and n (i.e., the link capacity which could be used by passengers using m \\u2192 n as a transit) considered in [3] . Hence, the computed effective distances would be different and the difference is explained in Appendix A. We compute the fraction of flows from China to any given countryof-interest and determine its effective distance. We develop a linear estimator for COVID-19 ToA at various countries using the effective distance to China. This allows us to \\\"predict\\\" when COVID-19 is most likely to be reported by various countries. Further, two countries with similar effective distances do not necessarily rank the same in terms of risk of sustained, undetected or uncontrolled epidemic outbreak. In order to capture this aspect, we consider the product of effective distance of a country to its IDVI to rank the countries by risk to COVID-19. The rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in China has led to series of suspensed operations by major airlines serving international traffic in and out of mainland China. Note that airline suspension can be complete or partial, and can affect the whole or part of an itinerary. Using the suspension data described earlier, we appropriately alter the flow volumes in the original air traffic network. To ensure that the effective distances on the air traffic network are comparable with and without interventions, we scale the flow volume in the latter with total outflow from origin in the former. Assuming that the total outflow from a country without airline suspensions is reflective of the country population size, normalizing the reduced flows with it could provide better estimates for P mn . Formally, if G is the original weighted flow network on which effective distance is computed from source i 0 , and G is the flow network derived by adjusting flow volumes based on airline suspensions, then the edge weights between nodes m and n on G ar\\u0113 F mn = F mn / n F mn , where F mn denotes the reduced flow between the nodes. Finally, we seek to identify potential factors that can explain the estimated reporting delays according to our model. We define estimated reporting delay as the difference between the time of arrival predicted by the linear estimator and the reported time of arrival according to WHO situation reports. We construct univariate linear regression models with the IDVI scores (overall and individual categories), and report the % of explained variance according to each of these indicators. We also evaluated the goodness of fit via a Wald test with a t-distribution against a null hypothesis of a slope of 0 and report the p-values. Using a linear model for the reported time of arrival against the effective distance computed on IATA data, we observe a moderately high coefficient of determination R 2 = 0.78. A scatter plot of COVID-19 ToA for countries with reported cases with respect to their effective distance from China is shown in Figure 1a . It should be noted that in the regression analysis, China has effective distance and time of arrival set to zero. The difference between reported ToA and linear estimator is provided in Figure 1b . The median error in estimation is less than a day with the estimated ToA typically being earlier than the reported ToA. Note that there are a few outliers which have much earlier reported ToA than estimated ToA (e.g., Nepal, Japan, Thailand). For these countries, airline traffic may not be representative of the total connectivity with China due to their spatial proximity (land or sea). In order to assess the risk of direct importation of COVID-19 from China to various countries we computed the estimated ToA for each country, using their effective distance from China (shown in Figure 2 ). The effective distance tree plot 3 clearly show that the early reporting countries indeed had the shortest effective distance to China (at the center). The predicted time of arrival using the linear estimator is shown in the map, excluding countries which do not have direct airline traffic from China. Finally, we plot the estimated times of arrival of all countries against their vulnerability (IDVI), grouped by the United States Combatant Commands, providing a natural geographic grouping. As demonstrated in Figure 2b , the countries with reported cases (shown with plus marker) are mostly to the left. Interestingly, most countries with reported cases also have higher IDVI, which may be due to a combination of (a) high connectivity and air traffic to China, (b) better detection and reporting capabilities for imported cases. In general, the lower left region (low IDVI and low estimated ToA) indicates a regime of high risk, which is relatively empty for this outbreak. However, we notice that several low IDVI countries (especially those in AFRICOM) are estimated to have times of arrival in the first three weeks of February. Equally concerning are countries to the left with circle markers, which have an early estimated time of arrival but haven't officially reported cases yet.  For a select set of countries, we compute their effective distance with and without airline suspensions and subsequently, the estimated ToA for each case. The top 20 countries as per the change in estimated ToA after suspension are presented in Figure 3a . Since our network alteration ensures monotonicity after flow volume reduction, we observe that a decrease in flow volumes results in increased estimate for ToA across all countries. We observe that most countries (Figure 3a) , on an average, see an increase in estimated arrival time of \\u2248 4 \\u2212 5 days, while, Ethiopia and Qatar observe an increase > 10 days.

The increase in ellipse widths and mean shift to the right (due to constant IDVI) between Figure 3b and Figure 3c indicate the effect of flight cancellations on estimated ToA. On an average, countries in AFRICOM see the largest average increase in estimated ToA of nearly 11 days, followed by countries in SOUTHCOM showing an average increase of 8 days. We recall that the output of our linear estimator is the expected ToA based on airline flow. We computed the estimated reporting delay for countries reporting before February 26th 2020 (36 of them according to WHO situation reports).

The results of univariate regressions of each of the IDVI scores is shown in Table 1 . We generally observe the negative relationship between the reporting delays (lower IDVI leads to higher reporting delays). Of the different normed scores, we see that the political scores (domestic and international) have the highest coefficients of determination (24% and 18% respectively, p < 0.05). The domestic score includes as components indicators of governance, corruption, decentralization, government stability, etc. while the international score captures aspects such as collaboration, international organization support and aid dependence. These are aspects which could have direct or indirect bearing on the detection and reporting of infectious disease outbreaks. The overall IDVI score explains about 16% of the variance (p < 0.05). While this is a reasonable first step, and does explain some of the apparent late reporting we are observing, we note that the estimated reporting delay may need to be replaced by other metrics of reporting Figure 4 .

Our work is an initial attempt at quantifying the impact of airline suspensions on COVID-19 direct importation risk. Some of the limitations of the current work can be overcome with more timely data availability and improved model assumptions. Firstly, the current observations are based on first official reports which in some cases can be quite different from first importations. Also, due to the evolving nature of the outbreak and limited observations, the linear estimator coefficients could change with new reports and altered travel conditions. While air traffic data from IATA allows us to quantify population exposure, (a) it is dated and may not be reflective of current conditions; (b) may not be representative of all human mobility between the countries. As we observed, some countries that are geographically closer to China (e.g., Nepal, Thailand and Japan) have very early arrival times (in relation to estimates based on effective distance). This highlights the need to account for multi-modal transport networks for quantifying the risk of global importations. However, this also raises concerns about other countries and regions (such as Pakistan, Myanmar and Northeastern India) which are geographically adjacent to China but haven't reported any cases yet. Notably, many of these regions scored relatively poorly on the indices of societal function, suggesting ties between the openness of a given regional government and the timeliness and accuracy of their data. Finally, we have considered China as a single origin, while there exists case counts by province. The current analysis can be extended by considering weighting the effective distance from multiple origins with their relative levels of infection. Further, while we have tried to incorporate data on airline suspensions, this may not be complete, and will not capture the actual reductions in flow volumes due to travel advisories, government restrictions and behavioral adaptations. There are also a number of screening procedures in place at international airports, which could potentially delay case importations. While providing a preliminary analysis using COVID-19 official reports and airline suspensions, this work also lays out a framework for rapid risk assessment for an emerging and ongoing outbreak. We believe that using near real-time multi-modal mobility datasets and detailed disease surveillance with qualitative and quantitative inputs on ongoing interventions and preparedness efforts will aid in swift and efficient global response to such outbreaks. \", \"On 31 December 2019, China notified an outbreak pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City to the World Health Organization (WHO) and it had been identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In January 2020, several cases were confirmed outside the Mainland of China and hence WHO has declared 2019-nCoV as a global health emergency. Approximately one month since the notification to the WHO, there were 24,663 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases worldwide where 29 countries were affected. January 25 in Malaysia, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported the first three confirmed cases of whom are of China nationality. The three infected patients were reported to have entered Malaysia from Singapore of which two days earlier, a confirmed case was notified by the Singapore authorities. The first infected Malaysian was reported on February 4. Based on the patient mobility report prior to the notification, it was noted that he was in Singapore for a week starting on January 16, 2020 to attend an international conference where some of the conference delegates were reported to have come from China. It was noted that this patient's symptoms appear on 23 January and he only seek for treatment on January 29 and was referred to the Sungai Buloh Hospital on February 2. The current understanding of the 2019-nCoV is that there is a possibility that the novel coronavirus can be asymptomatic. Thus, this paper aims to add insights into the epidemiology of 2019-nCoV by simulating the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV in Malaysia when one local human was infected. The transmission model was formulated based on the epidemiology aspects of the disease: (a) In this study, Malaysia's population is divided into the SEIR compartmental model which consists of four compartments: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I) and Recovered (R). The total population of Malaysia is denoted as N and it is assumed that the population is homogeneous. It is assumed that initially the total population is susceptible, hence S0 = N. (b) Based on the growing number of cases worldwide within a short period, the disease is assumed to spread sufficiently fast that the birth and the natural death rates can be considered as negligible in the model. .

Since the patient zero may be infectious and was mobile and freely interacting then susceptible human becomes exposed with the disease at a transmission rate f. Once exposed, the incubation period starts and then after the period ends then those exposed moves to the Infected compartment at a rate c and when they recovered from the disease then they will move to the Recovered compartment at a rate k. However, there are some infected cases who may die due to the disease with the given rate of d. The differential equations (equations (1) -(4)) which describe the dynamics of the 2019-nCoV in human populations are formulated based on the compartmental diagram described earlier in Figure 1 . !' The descriptions of the parameters and their values used for the simulation is shown in Table 1 . 1 c Incubation Period 6.5 [2] f Transmission rate of I to S 1.07 [3] 1 k Infectious Period 3.6 [3] d Death rate of 2019-nCoV 0.03 Estimated based on current statistics .

Hence the initial time (t0) is set to January 23, 2020 and I0 is 1. E0 and R0 are assigned to 0. Matlab 2019 is used in this study to simulate the SEIR model formulated using the parameter values listed in Table 1 . Figure 2 depicts the simulation of the SEIR model for the first ten days since the on-set date. Based on the result, the number of cases will increase to two persons which indicate that the second case will be confirmed on t = 8.74 which is approximately on the 9 th day after on-set date of the first case, that is on the 1 st February 2020. .

In figure 3 , the simulation is run for 300 days and it is observed that if there is no control measure taken then the disease will run its course from the on-set date of the first case until day t = 100 when the maximum number of infected cases are reached. This means that if there is no control intervention imposed on the situation then the disease will be able to infect more than 3 million in the country. The 2019-nCoV SEIR model was simulated using the parameters values obtained from trusted sources. The model is found to be accurate as it is able to predict the second confirmed case in Malaysia as reported on February 7 by the MoH [5] . One of the parameters used, namely the incubation period, was actually estimated by [2] based on 88 confirmed cases detected outside of Wuhan, China. Our simulation has managed to verify the proposed incubation period of 6.5 days at which according to the MoH report [5] , the second case has developed symptoms on the 1 st February 2020 which is in agreement with the prediction of our model. We have also shown through the simulation the seriousness of the spread of the disease if there is no control measure is taken. .

One such protein is non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9), which is thought to mediate both viral replication and virulence. Current understanding suggests that Nsp9 is involved in viral genomic RNA reproduction. Nsp9 is thought to bind RNA via a fold that is unique to this class of betacoronoaviruses although the molecular basis for this remains ill-defined. We sought to better characterise the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 protein and subsequently solved its X-ray crystal structure, in an apo-form and, unexpectedly, in a peptide-bound form with a sequence originating from a rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (LEVL). The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 revealed the high level of structural conservation within the Nsp9 family. The exogenous peptide binding site is close to the dimer interface and impacted on the relative juxtaposition of the monomers within the homodimer. Together we have established a protocol for the production of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, determined its structure and identified a peptide-binding site that may warrant further study from the perspective of understanding Nsp9 function. \", \"Objective: To investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their associations with public perceptions in China Design: Cross sectional population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 February, 2020 Setting: Wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and Shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with Wuhan) Participants: Random sample of 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai aged above 18 Main outcome measures: Anxiety (measured by the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out). Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score \\u226510 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p<0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4) , followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3). Conclusions: Psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information to address the high anxiety level. All rights reserved.

Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulencerelated genes in novel agents, as we show here for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. \", \"Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to explain some of the estimated reporting delays. \", \"This paper focuses on the formulation of a deterministic 2019-nCov transmission model by considering the exposed and recovered populations with immunity. The scenario of the simulation is depicted based on the patient zero in Malaysia. The transmission model is found to be able to predict the next confirmed case given a single case introduced in a fully susceptible population. The mathematical model is developed based on the SEIR model which has susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered populations. The system of equations which were obtained were solved numerically and the simulation results were analyzed. The analysis includes the impact of the disease if no control is taken. \"]]}, \"columnwidth\": [150, 350], \"header\": {\"values\": [\"Abstract\", \"Full_text\"]}, \"type\": \"table\"}],\n",

RSV also has a burden on healthcare services and winter mortality in older adults [2e4] . Published data on the epidemiology of nosocomial RSV infections are still limited. In infants, a severe course of nosocomial disease has been described, especially in subjects with comorbidities [5] , even more severe than community-acquired RSV infections [6] . In adults, RSV acquisition seems to be frequently nosocomial or healthcare-related, with a higher mortality than with influenza virus infection [7] . However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study compared the burden of community-acquired versus nosocomial RSV-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) in both adult and pediatric patients concomitantly admitted at the same hospital. Necker hospital (Paris) is a French 600 bed tertiary hospital, where large cohorts of adult and pediatric patients with chronic complex conditions (CCC) are regularly followed. A bundle of measures has been implemented to prevent nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs, including implementation of droplet and contact precautions for symptomatic patients, annual education and training of all healthcare personnel, providing instructional materials for patients and visitors on recommended hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene/cough practices and limitation of pediatric visitors during seasonal outbreaks of viral ALRIs. Infants predisposed to developing severe RSV disease receive passive antiviral immunization with palivizumab in accordance to French guidelines [8] . Finally, our hospital has recently been partly rebuilt and includes now a high rate of singlepatient rooms (91%), which may help to prevent healthcare-associated infections. This study aims to compare the burden of nosocomial and community-acquired RSV-associated ALRIs in both adult and pediatric inpatients and to evaluate the effectiveness of our infection control measures. Participants provided informed consent for the anonymous use of their clinical and biological data for biomedical research (for paediatric patients, informed consent was provided by parents/guardians). This study was reviewed and approved by the Necker Hospital Institutional Review Board (registration number in the registry of the Assistance Publique e H\\u00f4pitaux de Paris: 20190729122906). We performed a prospective observational study in adult and pediatric patients admitted to Necker hospital between October 1, 2018 and February 28, 2019, with a minimum hospital stay of 2 days and a diagnosis of RSV-associated ALRI. RSVinfected patients were identified from the data provided by the virology laboratory. RSV-associated ALRI was defined as diagnosis of pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchitis or bronchial hyper-reactivity with concomitant detection of RSV in upper respiratory (nose/throat swabs) or lower respiratory (bronchial aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) samples using PCR (RSV/hMPV r-gene\\u00d2-Argene\\u00d2, bioM\\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Patients with isolated upper respiratory tract infection and those without respiratory symptoms were excluded from this analysis, even if RSV was detected from their clinical samples. Because the RSV incubation period may range from 2 to 8 days [9] , the origin of ALRIs was designated as \\\"possibly nosocomial\\\" and \\\"definitely nosocomial\\\" when the patient had been hospitalized continuously 2e7 days and ! 8 days before the onset of respiratory symptoms, respectively. ALRIs were considered community-acquired in patients whose symptoms occurred before hospitalization or < 2 days after hospital admission. The clinical data collected included age, gender, term of birth (for infants), underlying complex chronic conditions (CCC; as previously defined [10] ), laboratory-confirmed bacterial and viral co-/supra-infections, level of care required (admission to the intensive care unit [ICU], ventilation requirement, prescription of antibiotics), length of hospital stay (in the case of nosocomial infection, the length of hospital stay after the onset of symptoms was recorded) and death. The number of hospital admissions and total hospitalization days of patients with ALRIs were compared to those of all patients admitted to our hospital during the study period, in order to estimate the burden of RSV infection. Finally, we evaluated the proportion of RSV-infected subjects who adequately received palivizumab-based prophylaxis before the onset of their ALRIs according to the 1999 marketing authorization of palivizumab by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [11] , the 2007 guidelines of the French Health Authority (HAS), [8] and the 2014 guidance for palivizumab use of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [12] . Categorical variables appear with their frequency distribution. Non-normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as the median and interquartile range. Chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare discrete variables, and the Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare continuous variables between patients with communityacquired versus nosocomial ALRIs. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Between October 2018 and February 2019, 229 patients admitted to our hospital were diagnosed with communityacquired RSV-associated ALRIs. Their characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . The majority were less than 6 months old (60.3%) and, among them, few were born preterm (18.8%). At least one CCC was present in 40.1% of subjects, most frequently a respiratory CCC. Viral and bacterial co-/supra-infections were documented in 17.5% and 5.7% of cases, respectively, but around one in two patients received antibiotics. The proportion of patients requiring ICU admission was high (40.1%) but only 3 patients (1.3%) died. All of them were children with severe cardiovascular AE respiratory CCC and died from acute respiratory distress syndrome. When compared to all other patients admitted to our hospital during the same period of time, patients with communityacquired RSV infections accounted for 1.6% of inpatients and 3.1% of the total number of hospitalization days. The burden of community-acquired RSV infections was disproportionately higher in pediatric than in adult patients: 2.1% versus 0.2% of the total number of pediatric and adult inpatients, respectively (p < 0.0001); 4.2% versus 0.2% of the total number of hospitalization days in pediatric and adult units, respectively (p < 0.0001). Among children with community-acquired RSV infections, palivizumab ebased prophylaxis was given to 6/18 (33.3%), 6/6 (100%) and 4/4 (100%) of those for whom antiviral prophylaxis was recommended by the 1999 EMA, the 2007 French and the 2014 American guidelines, respectively. Eleven patients were diagnosed with a possibly (n \\u00bc 6) or definitely (n \\u00bc 5) nosocomial RSV-associated ALRI (Table 1) . Almost half of them (45.1%) were 60 years old or older. All subjects with nosocomial RSV infection had at least one CCC but none of them died from RSV. Compared to inpatients with community-acquired RSVassociated ALRIs, those with nosocomial infections were more frequently adults (p \\u00bc 0.0005) and subjects with at least one CCC (p < 0.0001). The rates of viral and bacterial co-/suprainfections, oxygen/ventilation requirement, ICU admissions, antibiotic treatments and deaths did not differ between inpatients diagnosed with community-acquired versus nosocomial infections. However, the length of stay was statistically longer in the latter than in the former (p < 0.0001). When compared to all patients admitted to our hospital during the same period of time and free from communityacquired RSV-associated ALRIs, patients with nosocomial RSV ALRIs accounted for 0.08% of all inpatients and 0.17% of the total number of hospitalization days. The proportion of inpatients with nosocomial infections did not differ between children and adults (0.06% versus 0.15%, p \\u00bc 0.14). However, the total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial RSVinfected patients was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p < 0.0001). No children with nosocomial RSVreceived palivizumab ebased prophylaxis prior to the onset of their infection. Retrospectively, such prophylaxis was not recommended for any of these children by the EMA, the French or the American guidelines. To the best of our knowledge, we report one of the first studies evaluating the efficacy of the same bundle of infection control measures to prevent RSV ALRIs in both adult and pediatric patients admitted to the same tertiary hospital. Some results regarding community-acquired RSV infections requiring hospitalization are in line with previous reports: most of the subjects hospitalized with RSV were aged 12 months, and especially 6 months [13e21]. The median length of hospital stay was in the range of that reported in previous pediatric studies (between 2 and 11 days). However, the prevalence of admission to ICU and the mortality rate were higher than previously described in high-income countries (41.0% versus 2e12%, and 1.3% versus < 0.5%, respectively) [1] . This could be explained by the high prevalence of CCC in the population of children followed in our tertiary hospital, and, consequently, in those admitted for community-acquired RSV infections. This proportion was higher than in previous studies, where typically > 70% of children hospitalized with RSV-related ALRI/bronchiolitis had no underlying medical conditions [16e18,22e24]. Thus, the epidemiological characteristics of patients admitted at our hospital with community-acquired RSV infections cannot be extrapolated to other French pediatric centers. In our study, the burden of RSV among community-acquired ALRIs requiring hospitalization was strongly lower in adults compared to infants and children, despite the high prevalence of CCC (especially immunodeficiency) among adults followed in our center (data not shown). Our findings suggest that, although RSV has the potential to cause severe communityacquired ALRIs in high-risk adults (such as immunocompromised patients) [25] , RSV infections seem to rarely require hospitalization in this population. Few of our patients (2.6%) admitted with communityacquired infections received palivizumab-based antiviral prophylaxis prior to the onset of the infection. However, the retrospective evaluation of the medical files of all RSV-infected inpatients revealed that no other patient required palivizumab according to the 2007 French and the 2014 American guidelines [8, 12] . Our results suggest that guidelines of antiviral prophylaxis are appropriately applied in our center but that most of the patients admitted for RSV infections (and most of those admitted to pediatric ICU), did not fall into the recognized indications for RSV prophylaxis, as recently reported by Ghazaly et al. [26] . In light with the ongoing research into the development of new and more cost-effective strategies against RSV infections than palivizumab (including long acting monoclonal antibodies and vaccines), further larger studies defining the characteristics of patients hospitalized with severe RSV infections, may help to rethink the guidelines of RSV prophylactic strategies. RSV is known to be a major nosocomial hazard on paediatric wards, especially in cases of age less than 5 months, prematurity and chronic lung disease of prematurity [6] . Previous studies described rates of nosocomial RSV infections between 0.4 and 9.6% [6,27e29] , with poorer clinical outcomes than community-acquired RSV infections [6] . Contrasting with these results, we observed in our pediatric wards a low rate of nosocomial RSV-related ALRIs (0.06% of inpatients) and no death related to nosocomial RSV infection. This low rate of nosocomial infections could be related to our multifaceted infection control strategy including a high proportion of single-patient rooms (for both infected and uninfected patients), staff training repeated before each season of viral epidemics, screening of symptomatic patients, isolation/cohorting, hand washing, gloves and masks, gowns (for staff attending infants with respiratory symptoms) and restriction of visitors. Interestingly, our study suggests that the efficacy of this infection control strategy may be less effective in adult than in pediatric wards. Indeed, nosocomial infections were proportionately more frequently diagnosed in adults than community-acquired ALRIs (p < 0.0001) and the total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial RSV infection was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p < 0.0001). Similarly, Kestler M et al. recently described that RSV acquisition was frequently nosocomial or healthcarerelated in adults during flu season [7] . Although we did not observe the high RSV-related mortality described in adults by Kestler (14.7%), we described longer length of hospital stay in case of nosocomial versus community-acquired infections in adults. Our results suggest that, despite a low rate of nosocomial infections observed in adults (0.15% of inpatients), our multifaceted infection control strategy may be reinforced in adults wards in order to obtain similar results seen in pediatric units. Because of the low number of nosocomial infections during the 2018/2019 RSV epidemic, it could be interesting to repeat this study during several successive seasonal epidemics in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our bundle of measures in a larger population. This study has five main limitations. First, RSV-related ALRIs were defined from the data provided by the virology laboratory. Because RSV may not have been screened in a significant proportion of patients with ALRI, this study may underestimate the real burden of RSV infection in our center. This underestimation may be more pronounced in patients with mild symptoms (especially those with isolated upper respiratory tract infection), where RSV may have been less frequently screened than in case of severe infection. However this potential limitation does not hamper evaluation of the efficacy of our infection control strategy, which mainly aims to prevent severe infections. Second, although the ALRIs were primarily attributed to RSV by clinicians in all patients described in this study, we cannot exclude that viral and bacterial co-infections may have influenced their clinical outcome. This confounding factor cannot be excluded in our non interventional study because all other respiratory pathogens may not have been screened for. In order to evaluate the impact of this potential bias, further prospective studies are needed with systematic screening of all potential viral and bacterial coinfections. Third, this observational study does not allow the effectiveness of individual components of our multicomponent control measures to be assessed. Similar observation was done by French CE et al. in the recent review of published and unpublished literature about the effectiveness of control measures to prevent nosocomial RSV transmission events [30] . However, because similar preventive strategies were applied in all units of our center, this limitation does not hamper the comparison of their efficacy on pediatric versus adult wards. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate to what extent the compliance with each measure of our infection control bundle differs between adult and paediatric populations. Because nosocomial infections may be transmitted by healthcare personnel, visitors and patients, it would be interesting to differentiate the compliance to measures targeting each of these populations in such further studies. Fourth, as previously discussed, the high prevalence of CCC among patients followed in our tertiary hospital hampers extrapolation of our results to other French hospitals. The higher prevalence of CCC among patients with nosocomial versus community-acquired RSV infections (100.0% versus 41.0%) may at least partly explain the longer length of stay in the former than in the latter. Fifth, we used a very large definition of a nosocomial case, by pooling \\\"possibly\\\" and \\\"definitely\\\" nosocomial infections. In previous studies investigating the risk of RSV transmission to patients and providing a clear definition of a nosocomial case, various cut-off were used to define it (mostly 5 days or more after hospital admission) [30] . Here, we chose a wider definition of a nosocomial case (i.e. infection occurring in a patient hospitalized continuously ! 2 days before the onset of respiratory symptoms), because (i) the RSV incubation period may be as short as 2 days [9] , and (ii) we did not want to minimize the real burden of RSV nosocomial ALRIs. Interestingly, although we used such a wide cut-off, the burden was not high in our center. This limitation does not hamper comparison of the burden of nosocomial infections between pediatric and adult wards at our center. In summary, the burden of community-acquired infections requiring hospitalization is disproportionately higher in infants/children than in adults admitted to our center. Nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs rarely occurred, suggesting good efficacy of our multi-component preventive strategy. However, the burden of nosocomial infection was higher in adults than in children, suggesting that education and training of healthcare workers, patients and visitors about the risk of nosocomial respiratory viral disease should be reinforced on adult wards. The fact than > 97% of patients hospitalized with communityacquired or nosocomial RSV-associated ALRI were not considered at \\\"high-risk\\\" (i.e. requiring immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab) according to the French and American guidelines, highlights the urgent need to develop new and more cost-effective antiviral preventive strategies, in order to decrease the burden of RSV infections requiring hospitalizations. \", \"The risk of pneumonia increases markedly with age, and pneumonia is a leading cause of death among seniors [1, 2] . In the United States, an estimated 600,000 hospitalizations for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [3] and 59,000 deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza occur among seniors every year [4] . Despite the importance of CAP in this population, information on the epidemiology of CAP among seniors in the United States is limited. In particular, because many prior studies of pneumonia have included only hospitalized patients, the increasingly important contribution of outpatient disease is not well defined. To better assess the burden of CAP in seniors and to iden-bases that record immunizations, medication prescriptions, radiographic test reports, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)-coded diagnoses associated with outpatient visits and hospitalizations. Each member also has a paper medical record that included copies of hospital admission and discharge summaries and outpatient and emergency department visit notes. Hospitalizations for pneumonia among the study population had been identified and validated as part of a prior study of pneumococcal vaccine effectiveness [5] . In that study, hospitalizations assigned a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia (ICD-9-CM codes 480-487.0) or streptococcal or pneumococcal bacteremia (ICD-9-CM codes 038.0, 038.2, 041.0, 041.2, and 320.1) were selected for chart review. Cases of nosocomial pneumonia, defined as cases in which pneumonia symptoms developed after hospitalization or in which the patient had been hospitalized in the previous 7 days, were excluded. A confirmed episode of CAP involving hospitalization was defined by an indication that, at the conclusion of their clinical evaluation, the treating physicians considered pneumonia to be the etiology of the presenting illness. Episodes of pneumonia treated on an outpatient basis were presumptively defined by an outpatient or emergency department visit with a pneumonia ICD-9-CM code that was associated with both prescription of antibiotics and obtainment of a chest radiograph within 14 days after the visit. An outpatient episode of CAP was defined as confirmed if the chart review indicated that pneumonia was the most likely diagnosis attributed to the illness by the treating physician and if the patient had not been hospitalized in the prior 7 days. Definition of baseline covariates. To assess potential risk factors for pneumonia among the study population, a series of baseline covariates was defined from GHC administrative data sources and the regional cancer registry. These variables include ischemic cardiac disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma without COPD, renal disease, stroke, dementia, lung cancer, serious nonlung cancer, other cancer, diabetes mellitus, receipt of prednisone, receipt of other immunosuppressive medications, pneumonia hospitalization in the year prior to cohort entry, use of home oxygen, and receipt of home health care. The full definitions of these variables are provided in table A1 in Appendix A. Smoking status was defined on the basis of data routinely collected at GHC during outpatient visits [5] . Information on smoking status was missing for 12% of study subjects. These subjects differed in several characteristics from persons with known smoking status. Alternate analyses were conducted that excluded persons who were missing smoking information, but because the results did not vary substantially from the results of analyses of the entire study population, the results presented include persons with and persons without smoking data. Rates of pneumonia. Crude event rates were calculated by dividing the number of cases by the cumulative person-time in each age-and sex-specific stratum. Crude event rates were based on all events occurring during the study period and could include multiple events per person. To examine seasonal variation in pneumonia rates, biweekly crude rates were calculated by dividing the number of cases occurring in 2-week intervals by the cumulative person-time in each interval. We plotted these rates over time and compared the pattern of variation during and outside of influenza seasons with the pattern of proportionate mortality from pneumonia and influenza in the United States, as defined by national vital statistics data [6] . Influenza seasons were defined on the basis of local and national surveillance data [7] [8] [9] [10] . Statistical analysis. Differences in rates were assessed using the x 2 test. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models [11] were used to evaluate the association of baseline covariates with the time to first of each outcome event during the study period. Additional models were fit to test for the presence of an interaction between age or sex and other covariates with the risk of pneumonia. The attributable risk, attributable risk percentage, population-attributable risk, and population-attributable risk percentage of CAP cases associated with smoking were all calculated by comparing the crude rates of CAP in current smokers with the rates of CAP in former smokers and those who have never smoked using standard formulas [12] . The cohort consisted of 46,237 persons who contributed 122,605 person-years of observation during the study period. Overall, 42% of the subjects were male, 53% were aged 65-74 years at baseline, and 38% were aged 75-84 years at baseline (table 1). Hospitalizations for pneumonia. A total of 2486 hospitalizations associated with a pneumonia ICD-9-CM code among 2161 persons were identified. Information on 2371 (95%) of these events was available for review. Of these events, 45 were readmissions for pneumonia and 119 were episodes of nosocomially acquired pneumonia. Of the 2207 remaining hospitalizations, a clinical diagnosis of CAP was confirmed for 1411 (64%); 1264 cohort members accounted for these cases. An additional 2 confirmed hospitalizations for pneumonia were identified by chart review of hospitalizations associated with a bacteremia ICD-9-CM code. Thus, 1413 confirmed CAPassociated hospitalizations among 1266 persons were identified during the study period.  A total of 3153 episodes of presumptive outpatient pneumonia among 2736 persons were identified on the basis of administrative data, and records of 3124 (99%) of these events were available for review. Of these events, 86 episodes were excluded because a record of care for a respiratory illness was not verified, and 129 were excluded because the respiratory illness was associated with a hospitalization. Of the remaining 2909 events, a diagnosis of CAP was confirmed for 2063 (71%), which occurred among 1881 cohort members. Rates of CAP and the percentage of cases resulting in hospitalization increased with age (table 2). The rate of pneumonia was consistently higher among men than among women, across all age groups and for both hospitalized patients and outpatients with pneumonia, although the difference was not always statistically significant. Overall, 59.3% of CAP episodes were treated on an outpatient basis. Among persons aged \\u044385 years, the rate of CAP was 52.3 events per 1000 person-years, which is roughly 1 episode of pneumonia for every 20 persons per year. Among persons hospitalized for CAP, 12.5% died within 30 days after hospital admission. Among outpatients with pneumonia, 0.4% died within 30 days after the first diagnosis. Overall, 3.6% of all the deaths in the cohort during the study period occurred within 30 days after a CAP diagnosis. We found that the peak rates of all CAP (both hospitalizations and outpatient visits for pneumonia) coincided with periods of influenza viral circulation (figure 1). In addition, the seasonal pattern of CAP in our study population closely mirrored the temporal pattern of the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza nationally. Similar seasonal patterns were seen in analyses restricted to either outpatients or hospitalized patients, and the proportion of pneumonia episodes requiring hospitalization did not vary between influenza and noninfluenza periods, either for the cohort overall or by age group (data not shown). The attributable risk for smoking among the study cohort was 12.3 CAP events per 1000 person-years, and the attributable risk percentage for smoking was 30.8%. That is, assuming there is a causal relationship between smoking and CAP, we estimate that \\u223c30% of episodes of pneumonia among smokers were due to smoking. The population-attributable risk for smoking (among the population of persons with smoking data) was 1.3 CAP events per 1000 person-years, and the population-attributable risk percentage for smoking was 4.4%. That is, among the population of persons with smoking data, \\u223c4% of pneumonia events were due to smoking. There was no significant difference in the attributable risks of smoking across age groups or between men and women. In multivariate analysis, age, male sex, current smoking, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, lung cancer, serious nonlung cancer, COPD, asthma without COPD, dementia, stroke, receipt of prednisone, use of home oxygen services, greater number of outpatient visits, and hospitalization for pneumonia in the year prior to the study start date were independently associated with risk of all CAP (table 3) . In general, indicators of chronic illness at baseline were more strongly [7] [8] [9] [10] . For comparison, the biweekly proportion of all deaths in the United States attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I), as reported by national vital statistics data, is also presented [6] . associated with risk of hospitalization for pneumonia than of outpatient visits for pneumonia. The variable most strongly associated with all CAP was COPD. There was no significant interaction between age or sex and other covariates on risk of pneumonia. To our knowledge, this is the first contemporary study to assess rates of both hospitalizations and outpatient visits for pneumonia among community-dwelling seniors in the United States, and it provides, to our knowledge, the only populationbased assessment of risk factors for CAP among seniors in the United States. Our study builds on previous population-based studies of hospitalizations and outpatient visits for CAP conducted among communities in Finland [13, 14] and among the GHC population in the 1970s and early 1980s [15] , each of which had substantially fewer seniors in their study populations. Extrapolating our age-specific rates to the population of seniors in the United States who were not in nursing homes, as reported in 2000 census data [16] , we estimate a disease burden of 551,600 cases of CAP treated on an outpatient basis and 364,300 cases of CAP resulting in hospitalization, for a total of 915,900 cases of CAP. These rates also indicate that \\u223c1 of every 20 persons aged \\u044385 years will have a new episode of CAP each year. Our rates of hospitalizations for CAP are consistent with those reported by Marston et al. [1] in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sponsored prospective study of radi-ographically confirmed hospitalization for CAP patients in 2 counties in Ohio in 1991. After adjusting for differences in the age distribution of persons aged \\u044365 years in the 2 study populations, our age-adjusted hospitalization rate of 10.4 cases per 1000 person-years was nearly identical to the rate of 10.1 cases per 1000 person-years among community-dwelling seniors reported by Marston et al. [1] . The Ohio study did not, however, include an assessment of outpatient visits for CAP, which is particularly important, given the trend towards outpatient treatment that has occurred over the past 2 decades. We found that, even among persons aged \\u044380 years, nearly one-half (49.3%) of CAP events were treated on an outpatient basis. Inclusion of outpatient episodes allows a more comprehensive estimate of the burden of disease and a more accurate assessment of risk factors for CAP. Persons with chronic conditions who develop CAP are more likely to be hospitalized for treatment than are persons without chronic conditions. This means that assessments restricted to hospitalizations for CAP will likely overestimate the association of those conditions with the risk of CAP. The availability of administrative data on the GHC population allowed us to define the presence of underlying conditions consistently across the study population. Because of this, we were able to assess the independent association of those characteristics with risk of pneumonia in multivariate analyses. As previously reported among adults, we found that COPD, immunosuppression, smoking, and congestive heart failure were all independently associated with disease risk among sen- iors [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . In addition, we also found that diabetes, lung cancer, serious nonlung cancer, and previous hospitalizations for pneumonia were also risk factors for CAP among elderly persons. In this cohort, rates of CAP were higher in men than in women, and male sex was a risk factor for CAP even after adjusting for age, smoking, and the presence of chronic medical conditions. A survey of hospitalizations associated with a pneumonia ICD-9-CM code reported in Medicare claims [3] found a significantly higher risk among men than among women, as did a follow-up assessment of the risk of a hospitalization associated with a pneumonia diagnosis among participants of the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHA-NES I) [17] . Neither of these studies assessed whether male sex was associated with pneumonia after adjusting for other risk factors, so it was not clear in these studies whether male sex was simply a marker for a higher prevalence of other risk factors. A population-based study involving 4175 elderly persons in Finland found that crude CAP rates did not differ between men and women and that male sex was not significantly associated with CAP after accounting for age and certain chronic medical conditions and risk factors, including asthma, receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, and heart disease [21] . Because our study population was much larger than that of the Finnish study, we have more power to detect an independent risk of CAP associated with male sex if such a risk truly exists. However, it is possible that the difference in risk we observed could be the result of confounding by factors unmeasured in our population. We found that current smokers were at an increased risk of hospitalization for CAP, which is consistent with previous reports. Previous case-control studies have shown that smoking is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia [19, 22] . One study has reported that, among adults who quit smoking, the excess risk of CAP appears to have decreased 5 years after quitting [22] . We estimate that, among elderly smokers, nearly one-third of pneumonia episodes can be attributed to smoking, suggesting that smoking cessation could potentially reduce the risk of CAP among smokers by an important degree. Among our study population, the seasonal pattern of pneumonia closely followed the pattern of pneumonia and influenza mortality nationally. Correlations between rates of hospitalization for acute respiratory disease and patterns of influenza activity have been reported in adult populations in other geographic areas [23] [24] [25] . The 1999-2000 influenza season is recognized as having been more severe than the several preceding seasons [10] , and timing of the peak rate of CAP for the elderly GHC population in this study period closely matched the peak proportional pneumonia and influenza mortality rates in the United States, occurring in late December 1999 and early January 2000. This correlation suggests that data from health management organizations (HMOs) on pneumonia-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits could be an additional method for identifying periods of influenza virus circulation or quantifying the severity of influenza seasons. Rates of CAP in this population were high, especially among some subgroups of subjects, such as those aged \\u044385 years, and there was close correlation with influenza virus circulation. This is despite the fact that vaccination rates for both influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines were high in this population. Annual influenza vaccination rates among the study population were 170%, and 175% of subjects received pneumococcal vaccine either prior to or during the study period, emphasizing the need for other measures for preventing pneumonia in seniors. The burden of illness could potentially be reduced by the availability of other vaccines, such as pneumococcal conjugate vaccines or vaccines effective against human metapneumovirus or respiratory syncytial virus infection. Alternatively, increased emphasis on other strategies to reduce the risk of influenza infection, such as vaccination of caregivers and household contacts, could potentially impact disease risk. One limitation of this study is the possible underascertainment of pneumonia events, because our case finding was primarily restricted to medical encounters assigned a pneumonia ICD-9-CM code, and so would not capture pneumonia episodes associated exclusively with other diagnosis codes. For outpatient pneumonia, we would also have missed episodes in which a chest radiograph was not ordered. We cannot estimate the extent to which underascertainment may have influenced our results. However, this problem is likely to be more significant for pneumonia treated on an outpatient basis (in which a health care provider may only see a patient early in the course of the illness and assign a diagnosis before the evaluation has been completed) than in cases in the hospital setting (in which the discharge diagnoses are assigned at the end of the hospital stay and should represent a more complete assessment of the illness episode). A second limitation is that the study population includes enrollees of a single health maintenance organization in a single geographic area, and the findings may not be generalizable to the US population as a whole. As noted above, however, our age-standardized rate of CAP-related hospitalizations was essentially identical to that observed in the study of CAP in Ohio [1] . This similarity, along with the close correspondence between the observed rates over time in our study and the national proportional rates of mortality due to pneumonia and influenza, suggest that our study population is not dissimilar from the elderly population of the United States as a whole. Our method for detection of both hospitalizations and outpatient visits for CAP among a defined population of HMO enrollees has several advantages for conducting pneumonia surveillance. This type of surveillance can identify high-risk subgroups, can track trends in pneumonia incidence over time, and is suitable for both prospective and retrospective studies. Surveillance of this type would be particularly useful for studying the effect of new vaccines or the introduction of new pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, on rates of pneumonia.  \", \"tify novel agents. Of the 3 novel agents identifie in the last 3 years-including human metapneumovirus [3] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4] , and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) [5, 6 ]-2 are coronaviruses. On the basis of serological and phylogenetic characterization, coronaviruses were divided into 3 distinct groups: human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and HCoV-NL63 are group 1 coronaviruses, and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is a group 2 coronavirus [7] . HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 account for 5%-30% of human respiratory tract infections [8] , whereas, in a few recent studies, HCoV-NL63 was found to be present in 2%-3.6% of respiratory specimens [9] [10] [11] . In 2002 and 2003, the epidemic caused by SARS-CoV affected 18000 people, with 750 deaths [4, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Table 1 .

Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that CoV-HKU1 is a distinct group 2 coronavirus, with G + C content of 32%, the lowest among all known coronaviruses. Although preliminary screening also identifie an additional patient with pneumonia with CoV-HKU1 in her nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), the epidemiological and clinical features of CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia remain to be determined. In the present study, using prospectively collected NPAs, we examined the prevalence of CoV-HKU1 in patients with community-acquired pneumonia during a 12-month period. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia were described. The molecular epidemiological profil of CoV-HKU1 was also analyzed. All prospectively collected NPAs from patients with community-acquired pneumonia that were sent to the clinical microbiology laboratories of 4 hospitals in Hong Kong during a 12-month period (22 March 2003 [the beginning of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong] to 21 March 2004) for detection of SARS-CoV and were found to be negative for SARS-CoV RNA, by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [20] , were included in the study. Community-acquired pneumonia is de- [16] . To determine possible risk factors associated with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia, 2 age-and sex-matched controls per patient with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia were randomly selected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia whose NPAs were found to be negative for CoV-HKU1. Controls were within 5 years in age (older or younger) of the corresponding patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia and were admitted within 15 days before or after admission of the corresponding patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia. The hospital records, laboratory results, and chest ra- diographs of the controls were examined by 2 infectious disease physicians. RNA extraction. Viral RNA was extracted from NPAs using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAgen) within 10 h of receipt of specimens. The eluted RNA (template for RT-PCR) was stored immediately at \\u03ea70\\u040aC until use. A 453-bp fragment of the pol gene of CoV-HKU1 was amplifie by RT-PCR using CoV-HKU1-specifi primers (LPW1926 [5 -AAAGGATGTTG-ACAACCCTGTT-3 ] and LPW1927 [5 -ATCATCATACTAAA-ATGCTTACA-3 ]) designed by multiple alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the pol genes of CoV-HKU1 [19] and those of other coronaviruses. RT was performed using the Su-perScript II kit (Invitrogen). The PCR mixture (50 mL) contained cDNA, PCR buffer, 200 mmol/L each dNTP, and 1.0 U of Taq polymerase (Boehringer). The mixtures were amplifie in 40 cycles of 94\\u040aC for 1 min, 48\\u040aC for 1 min, and 72\\u040aC for 1 min and a fina extension at 72\\u040aC for 10 min. To ensure the high specificit of the CoV-HKU1-specifi primers, RNA extracted from 200 NPAs positive for influenz A and B viruses, parainfluenz viruses 1-3, RSV, or adenovirus antigens and RNA from 12 NPAs positive for HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, or SARS-CoV RNA (3 samples/coronavirus) were also subjected to RT-PCR using the 2 CoV-HKU1-specifi primers. The amplifie products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, as described elsewhere [19] . Both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice by use of an ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), using the 2 PCR primers. The sequences of the PCR products were compared with the sequences of the pol genes of CoV-HKU1 [19] and those of other coronaviruses in the GenBank database. ELISA using recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein of CoV-HKU1. The ELISA-based IgG and IgM antibody tests were performed in accordance with our published protocol [19] . Each sample was tested in duplicate, and the mean absorbance for each serum sample was calculated. The complete pol, S, and N genes of CoV-HKU1 from NPAs from 9 of the 10 patients from whom adequate amounts of RNA were available were amplifie and sequenced using the strategy described in our previous study [19] and the primers listed in table 1. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the pol, S, and N genes were compared with those of CoV-HKU1 [19] and other group 2 coronaviruses. Phylogenetic tree construction was performed using the PileUp method with GrowTree (Genetics Computer Group). Statistical analysis. A comparison of characteristics was made between patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia and those with non-CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia and between patients who died of and those who survived CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia. Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables. was regarded as statistically P ! .05 significant Clinical and laboratory characteristics. During the 12-month period, NPAs from 418 patients (men:women, 198:220; mean \\u202b\\u05e2\\u202c SD age, years) in 4 hospitals with community-ac-49 \\u202b\\u05e2\\u202c 26 quired pneumonia were found to be negative for SARS-CoV RNA by RT-PCR. A 453-bp fragment of the pol gene of CoV-HKU1 was amplifie and sequenced for 10 patients (2.4%). Sequence analysis revealed 0%-2% nucleotide differences between the sequences of the fragments and the sequence of the pol gene from The epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of the 10 patients with CoV-HKU1-associated community-acquired pneumonia are summarized in table 2. No epidemiological linkage was identifie among the 10 cases. All cases occurred during either spring or winter (January-May). The median age of these patients was 71.5 years (range, 13-96 years). Seven were men, and 3 were women. Eight had underlying diseases, of whom 4 had underlying diseases of the respiratory tract. Four had recently traveled to southern China. Five were smokers. Clinically, the illness was not distinguishable from other community-acquired pneumonia illnesses. Fever, productive cough, and dyspnea were common symptoms at presentation. Upper respiratory tract symptoms were present in only 2 patients (patients 1 and 5). One patient (patient 7) had loose-stool diarrhea. Oxygen saturation levels on room air on admission were !95% in 2 patients. Airspace shadows were observed in the right lungs of 6 patients and in the left lungs of 6 patients. The upper, middle, and lower zones were affected in 2, 4, and 9 patients, respectively. All patients, except patient (table 3) . None of the 10 patients in this control group from whom serum samples were available had a 4-fold increase in IgG titer or the presence of IgM against CoV-HKU1. Two of the 10 patients died of CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia. The firs patient (patient 2) was a 66-year-old man who had presented with dyspnea for 1 day. He had type 2 diabetes mellitus, old myocardial infarction, and gastric lymphoma with total gastrectomy in 2002 and was treated with chemotherapy. He had severe lymphopenia ( lymphocytes/L) and an 9 0.2 \\u03eb 10 oxygen saturation level of only 83% on admission. Chest radiographic examination revealed patchy airspace shadows in both lungs, with predominant involvement of the lower zones (figu e 2A). He died 11 days after admission. The other patient (patient 10) was a 72-year-old man who had presented with fever and productive cough for 1 week. He had type 2 diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, and prostatic carcinoma with bone metastasis complicated by spinal cord compression; laminectomy and Luque instrumentation were performed. He had lymphopenia ( lymphocytes/L), thrombocytopenia 9 0.9 \\u03eb 10 ( thrombocytes/L), deranged liver and renal function 9 33 \\u03eb 10 test results, and an oxygen saturation level of only 88% on admission. Chest radiographic examination revealed extensive airspace shadows in both lungs, with the middle zones more severely involved (figu e 2B). He died 5 days after admission. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of patients who survived and those who died of CoV-HKU1-associated community-acquired pneumonia were compared (table 4). Patients who died had lower hemoglobin concentrations (P p .04), monocyte counts (P p .04), serum albumin levels (P p .04), and oxygen saturation levels on admission (P p .03) and had bilateral involvement ( ) and more zones involved P p .003 ( ) on chest radiographs. P p .01 The complete pol, S, and N genes of CoV-HKU1 from NPAs from 9 of the 10 patients from whom adequate amounts of RNA were available were amplifie and sequenced. The phylogenetic trees and nonsynonymous mutations and the corresponding amino acid changes are shown in figu e 3. For the S gene, there were 317 and 306 nt positions with synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations, respectively (figu e 3B); 72% and 28% of the nonsynonymous mutations were in the putative S1 and S2, respectively (figu e 4). For the N gene, there were 42 and 53 nt positions with synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations, respectively (figu e 3C). The nucleotide sequences of 7 of the 9 S or N genes showed similar sequences (genotype A), and those of the other 2 genes also showed similar sequences (genotype B) (figu e 3B and 3C). For the CoV-HKU1 specimen from patient 1, 2 peaks (T and C) were consistently observed at nt 1300 of the N gene, suggesting the presence of a quasi species (figu e 3C). For the pol gene, there were 95 and 13 nt positions with synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations, respectively (figu e 3A). The nucleotide sequences of the pol genes in the 7 CoV-HKU1 specimens of genotype A were also clustered together (figu e 3A). Interestingly, the 7 CoV-HKU1 specimens of genotype A were from 7 patients with underlying diseases, and the 2 specimens of genotype B were from the 2 patients without underlying diseases (table 2) . Furthermore, multiple alignments of the nucleotide sequences of the pol genes from the 9 CoV-HKU1 specimens and those from the HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and SARS-CoV supported the notion that the primers used in the present study were specifi for CoV-HKU1. CoV-HKU1, a novel group 2 coronavirus, is associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Since the SARS epidemic in 2003, we have started to prospectively collect NPAs from patients with community-acquired pneumonia and store the extracted RNA, so that, when a novel virus is discovered, the epidemiological and, hence, the clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of the disease can be studied in a timely manner. In January 2004, we discovered a novel coronavirus, CoV-HKU1, from a patient with community-acquired pneumonia [19] . The RNA extracted from prospectively collected NPAs was immediately retrieved, and the presence of CoV-HKU1 was investigated. Ten of the 418 NPAs were positive for CoV-HKU1, giving an incidence of 2.4%. The presence of CoV-HKU1 in these specimens was genuine-that is, it was not due to contamination-since amplificatio and sequencing of multiple genes (pol, S, and N) of CoV-HKU1 indicated the presence of CoV-HKU1 with different nucleotide sequences from the different patients. Moreover, the clinical significanc of CoV-HKU1 was confi med by the presence of a specifi antibody response in all 6 patients from whom serum samples were available. The antibody response in these patients was unlikely to be the result of cross-reaction with other known human coronaviruses, since none of the 20 serum samples obtained from patients with HCoV-OC43 infections or SARS-CoV pneumonia had positive results in the recombinant N ELISA (authors' unpublished data). Further studies on detection of CoV-HKU1 in NPAs from healthy individuals will determine whether asymptomatic shedding of CoV-HKU1 occurs. Similar to HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1 is a human coronavirus that is endemic in humans. Similar to other human coronavirus infections, cases of CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia occurred during winter and spring. Most patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia were old (80% were 165 years old) and had major underlying diseases, especially those of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. To study the phylogeny and relationships among the 10 CoV-HKU1 specimens, we sequenced the pol, S, and N genes from the 9 CoV-HKU1 specimens that contained adequate amounts of RNA. Combined with the data on partial sequencing of the pol genes from the 10 CoV-HKU1 specimens (figu e 1), results showed that, unlike the epidemiological profil of SARS-CoV, the 10 CoV-HKU1 specimens were not clonal, and the topology of the phylogenetic trees did not follow the pattern of a clonal outbreak (figu e 3). Interestingly, the phylogenetic trees constructed using the sequences of both the S and N genes showed that CoV-HKU1 of genotype B was detected in NPAs from with 2 patients without underlying diseases, but CoV-HKU1 of genotype A was detected in NPAs from patients with underlying diseases (figu e 3B and 3C). Sequencing of more CoV-HKU1 specimens may reveal the presence of genotypes or clades of CoV-HKU1 with differential virulence. Compared with SARS-CoV pneumonia, CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia is a monophasic disease, and most patients had relatively mild symptoms that were localized to the respiratory tract and were, therefore, hospitalized only briefl . SARS-CoV pneumonia is often described as a biphasic disease, with the firs phase due to cell lysis as a result of viral replication and the second phase due to immunopathological damage [4, 12] . On the other hand, all 10 patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia showed the pattern of a monophasic disease. Although dyspnea was present in one-half of the patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia at presentation, compared with only \\u223c20% of patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia at presentation [4] , patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia often recovered quickly, but patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia deteriorated after 7-10 days [4, 12] . For the 8 patients who recovered, the median duration of hospitalization was only 5.5 days. This rapid recovery of patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia could be related to the rapid control of the virus by the immune system. This is in line with the results of our previous study, which showed that the index patient with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia had his peak viral load at around day 3 after the onset of illness [19] . Moreover, only 1 of the patients had extrapulmonary symptoms, and all available extrapulmonary specimens (stool, urine, and serum) were negative, by RT-PCR, for CoV-HKU1 (authors' unpublished data). On the other hand, for SARS-CoV pneumonia, patients usually had their peak viral loads 7-10 days after onset of illness [12] . Furthermore, the virus can be readily detected in extrapulmonary specimens, in which the viral loads correlated with the manifestations in the corresponding systems [22] . These finding imply that the virus was not well controlled by the immune system during the initial phase of the illness. Despite the relatively mild course of disease in most patients, CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia is associated with mortality in a minority of patients who have lower hemoglobin concentrations, monocyte counts, serum albumin levels, and oxygen saturation levels on admission and more-extensive involvement on chest radiographs. As in most cases of pneumonia, extensive involvement in the lungs will result in poor gaseous exchange and, hence, hypoxia and eventually death. The lower hemoglobin concentrations, monocyte counts, and serum albumin levels could represent poorer premorbid states and narrower margins to figh against infections. Both patients who died had underlying diabetes mellitus, malignancy (gastric lymphoma in one and prostate carcinoma in the other), and cardiovascular disease (old myocardial infarction in one and cerebrovascular accident in the other). \", \"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still a leading cause of death among children aged less than 5 years worldwide, with an estimate of 0.921 million deaths in 2015. Indeed, CAP was second only to preterm birth complications, being the leading cause of death in countries with high under-5 mortality rate, yet important in medium high, and medium child mortality countries. 1 Furthermore, CAP imposes a substantial burden on health services and is a major cause of hospital referral and admission. According to the last estimate, in 2010, roughly 265,000 deaths due to CAP took place in hospitals, 99% of them in developing countries. 2 Therefore, it is possible to observe that 81% of deaths happened outside hospitals, 2 particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia countries. 1 In Brazil, during 2017, 1,117,779 hospital admissions occurred among children under 5 years, and the most frequent causes of admission were respiratory disease (351,763; 31.5%), perinatal complications (277,212; 23.5%), and infectious/parasitic illnesses (163,958; 14.7%). 3 Regarding mortality, 2,349 deaths due to respiratory disease were registered in the same age range, in Brazil, in 2017, i.e., 0.7% of the cases hospitalized died (case fatality rate). 3 These figures are in agreement with the findings of mortality and morbidity according to the economic development of the countries, 1 as Brazil is an upper middle income country. 4 That is, although CAP is not a frequent cause of death, it is a major cause of hospital admission in Brazil. Due to its impact on childhood morbidity and mortality, in health care assistance, it is paramount to be updated in diagnosing and treating children with CAP. Thus, this study aimed to provide cutting-edge information for the management of CAP patients under 5 years, based on the latest evidence published in the literature. Up to the 1990's, bacterial infections were the main concern about CAP etiology, particularly pneumococcal infection. Besides being a classical concept in medicine, derived from the available bacteriological assays that were routinely used to investigate CAP etiology, this concept was highlighted by the finding that death due to CAP was mainly secondary to bacterial infection. 5 Based on this finding, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a program with guidelines aiming to identify children at risk of having CAP, who should receive empiric antibiotic treatment promptly. 6 As a matter of fact, this program was quickly deemed to have a substantial effect on child mortality. 7 Between the end of the last century and the beginning of the current one, significant changes occurred in the childhood CAP scenario. Firstly, the progressive implementation of bacterial conjugate vaccines, specifically the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), 8 the most frequent bacterial causative agents of CAP among children under 5 so far. 9 It has been recognized that the widespread use of Hib vaccine and PCV in countries with high child mortality has been associated with reductions in Hib and pneumococcal cases and deaths. 8 Secondly, the successively widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques (PCRs) has been impacting on the estimation of the proportion of respiratory virus infections in childhood CAP. 10 In an American study conducted in 2,219 children (<18years-old) hospitalized due to CAP, between 2010 and 2012, respiratory viruses were detected in 1,627 (73.3%), out of which 1,472 (90.5%) had only viruses detected. 11 In a Swedish study conducted at the pediatric emergency room or inpatient wards between 2011 and 2014, 121 cases with radiographic evidence of CAP and 240 healthy controls were enrolled, out of which 81% and 56%, respectively, had viruses found; the authors reported that influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were detected in 60% of cases and were significantly associated with CAP with odds ratios >10. 12 In an Australian study carried out in 230 children (<18-years-old) hospitalized with CAP and 230 healthy controls, between 2015 and 2017, respiratory viruses, particularly RSV and HMPV, were major contributors for CAP etiology. 13 The authors estimated that RSV, HMPV, influenza, adenovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were responsible for 20.2% (95% CI: 14.6---25.5), 9.8% (5.6%---13.7%), 6.2% (2.5%---9.7%), 4% (1.1%---7.1%), and 7.2% (3.5%---10.8%) of hospitalizations, respectively. 13 In turn, in a multi-center study conducted in eight developing countries (Cambodia, China, Haiti, India, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, and Paraguay), between 2010 and 2014 (the GABRIEL study), 888 cases hospitalized with radiologically confirmed CAP and 870 healthy controls were recruited; at least one microorganism was detected in 93% of the cases and in 74.4% of the controls. Streptococcus pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, HMPV, rhinovirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus 1, 3, and 4, and influenza virus A and B were independently associated with pneumonia and the authors speculate that increasing S. pneumoniae vaccination coverage may substantially reduce the burden of CAP among children in developing countries. 14 In Brazil, two distinct studies thoroughly investigated CAP etiology. In the first one, 184 hospitalized cases with radiologically-confirmed CAP were included, and only viral, only bacterial, and viral-bacterial infections were found in 67 (36%), 34 (18%), and 43 (23%) patients, respectively, being rhinovirus (21%) and S. pneumoniae (21%) the most common pathogens. 16 Parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 (17%), RSV (15%), influenza A and B (9%), human bocavirus (HBoV; 8%), enterovirus (5%), HMPV (4.1%), and adenovirus (3%) infections were diagnosed. 16---18 In the second study, 774 non-hospitalized cases were recruited, out of which 708 (91.5%) had viruses detected, 491 (69.4%) with multiple viruses; rhinovirus (46.1%), adenovirus (38.4%), enterovirus (26.5%), RSV (24.9%), parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4 (20.5%), HMPV (12.9%), influenza A and B (8.5%), and coronavirus OC43, NL63, and 229E (8.3%) were found. 19 In this study, all viruses were significantly more frequent among cases with multiple detections, except for RSV and influenza viruses. 19 Furthermore, acute HBoV infection was serologically confirmed in 38 (5.0%) of the 759 cases with available paired serum samples. 20 Typical bacterial infections were also searched for, by employing quantitation of specific IgG titers: out of 690 patients with paired serum samples available for these assays, the rate of antibody responses was 15.4% for at least one pneumococcal protein antigen, 5.8% for H. influenzae, and 2.3% for M. catarrhalis; the detection rate of significant antibody increase for at least one of these three bacteria was 20.4%. 21 Atypical bacterial infections were also investigated: M. pneumoniae acute infection was diagnosed through the detection of specific IgM antibodies in the convalescent serum sample, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis acute infections were diagnosed through the detection of specific IgM antibodies or by significant IgG or IgA titer change. Overall, M. pneumoniae (86/787; 10.9%), C. pneumoniae (79/733; 10.8%), and C. trachomatis (3/28; 10.7%) acute infections were diagnosed, and 147 (20.1%) out of 731 patients investigated for these three bacteria had acute infection by at least one of these three bacteria (18 patients had concomitantly positive tests for acute M. pneumoniae and acute C. pneumoniae infection). 22 Based on the aforementioned data, it is possible to observe that respiratory viruses have been increasingly implicated in childhood CAP etiology, along with the recognition that viral infections have been more frequent than bacterial infections, even in developing countries. The screening of children with complaints of acute respiratory infection to diagnose pneumonia relies initially on clinical aspects. Since the early 1990's, the WHO has recommended the use of quantitative tachypnea (age-specific elevated respiratory rates) to identify children that would require treatment with antibiotics for possible pneumonia. 6 It is necessary to clarify that the WHO respiratory rate criteria were selected based on field, observational studies in target epidemiologic settings due to their high sensitivity, reasonable specificity, and ease of implementation where access to formal medical evaluation was limited. Additionally, the evidence base for establishing these criteria is prior to the introduction of vaccines against Hib and S. pneumoniae, regarded as the two major causes of CAP mortality. 23 It is also necessary to emphasize that the WHO respiratory rate criteria are not a diagnostic approach; instead, it was recommended to be employed as an easy tool to identify, among children under 5 years with acute respiratory infection complaints, those who had chance to have a compromised lower respiratory tract, who could then be at risk of dying. In a recently published systematic review of the accuracy of symptoms and physical examination findings to identify cases with radiographic pneumonia among children younger than 5 years, 23 prospective cohort studies of children were included (eight from North America), among which the prevalence of radiographic pneumonia in North American studies was 19% and 37% outside of North America. The presence of moderate hypoxemia (oxygen saturation \\u226496%) and increased work of breathing (grunting, flaring, and retractions) were signs most associated with pneumonia, whereas normal oxygenation (oxygen saturation >96%) decreased the likelihood of pneumonia. Curiously, tachypnea (respiratory rate >40 breaths/min) was not strongly associated with pneumonia diagnosis. 24 Indeed, the limitations of respiratory rate-based pneumonia diagnosis also include overdiagnosis, due to the inclusion of cases of asthma and other respiratory ailments that compromise the lower respiratory tract. 25 In a study conducted in three rural hospitals in Rwanda between May 2011 and April 2012, 147 cases were analyzed and 58% had radiologist-diagnosed pneumonia; the accuracy for diagnosing radiologically-confirmed pneumonia was assessed in 31 historical, clinical, and laboratory signs. Oxygen saturation was the best clinical predictor; its area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.675 [95% CI: 0.581---0.769]; p = 0.001) was higher than that of the respiratory rate (0.528 [95% CI: 0.428---0.627]; p = 0.588). 26 In Malawi, between 2012 and 2014, 13,266 children aged 2---59 months with clinically-diagnosed pneumonia were evaluated; those authors demonstrated that oximetry increased the referral rate for severely hypoxemic children without chest indrawing or danger signs. 27 Indeed, when oximetry data were excluded, retrospective application of the guidelines published by WHO in 2014 28 failed to identify a considerable proportion of severely hypoxemic children eligible only via oximetry. 27 Furthermore, it had been shown that pulse oximetry can not only significantly increase the incidence of correctly treated severe cases but also reduce the incidence of incorrect treatment with antibiotics. 29 The gold standard usually considered in the investigation of predictive signs of pneumonia is radiologically-confirmed pneumonia. Radiologic findings consistent with pneumonia include pulmonary infiltrate, either alveolar or interstitial; alveolar infiltrate is characterized as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or the entire lobe, or even the entire lung, which may or may not contain air-bronchogram, and interstitial infiltrate is defined as linear and patchy densities in a lacy pattern. 30 Interestingly, it had been demonstrated that the sensitivity (95% CI) of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia for pneumococcal infection was 93% (80%---98%); conversely, the negative predictive value (95% CI) of normal chest X-ray was 92% (77%---98%). 31 These findings were detected among hospitalized 31 and non-hospitalized children. 32 Thus, the findings of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia are actually predictors of bacterial pneumonia. Moreover, if the frequency of bacterial pneumonia is decreasing due to the wide implementation of the conjugate vaccines (Hib and PCVs), the accuracy of those predictors may change over time and among different settings, depending on vaccines coverage. From a practical standpoint, bacterial pneumonia should be the target as children with typical bacterial infections, alone or complicated by a viral infection, have worse outcomes than those infected with a virus alone. 11 In a prospective cross-sectional study that investigated CAP etiology (11 viruses and eight bacteria) in hospitalized children under 5 years, the frequency of signs and symptoms was assessed in patients with viral or exclusively bacterial infection; 188 patients had a probable etiology established as only viral (51.6%), mixed viral-bacterial (30.9%), and only bacterial infection (17.5%). Asthma was observed in 21.4%. In the multivariable analysis, viral infection (AdjOR [95% CI]: 9.6; 95% CI: 2.7---34.0), asthma (AdjOR [95% CI]: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.9---11.0), and age (AdjOR [95% CI]: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.97) were independently associated with wheezing on physical examination. The positive predictive value of detected wheezing for viral infection was 96.3% (95% CI: 90.4---99.1%). The authors concluded that wheezing detected on physical examination is an independent predictor of viral infection. 33 However, wheezing does not rule out bacterial infection. As in practice it is not only necessary to identify children with CAP, but mainly those with probable bacterial infection, it is possible that the combination of normal chest X-ray, detection of wheezing upon physical examination, and pulse oximetry may be useful for this goal. This is a potential issue for future research. The use of blood inflammatory biomarkers to distinguish bacterial from viral CAP has been investigated. Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have shown some value in the identification of bacterial infections 34,35 but it has not been established yet a relevant clinical cut-off point for their use. 36 For instance, in an Italian randomized clinical trial, children with non-severe CAP were admitted at the hospital specifically to be included in this PCT investigation: 155 received antibiotics if the mean serum PCT upon admission was \\u22650.25 ng/mL and the remaining 155 children received antibiotics based on the clinical evaluation of the attending physician. Antibiotics were prescribed to 133 children (85.8%) from the first group and 155 children (100%) from the second group, (p < 0.05). The length of antibiotics use was lower (5.37 vs. 10.96; p < 0.05) as well as the frequency of adverse events related to antibiotics use (3.9% vs. 10.96%; p < 0.05) in the group that had serum PCT measured. It is necessary to emphasize that none of the patients who did not receive antibiotics worsened or needed antibiotics afterwards. 37 A Brazilian study described that serum PCT upon admission below 0.25 ng/dL had high negative predictive value for pneumococcal infection (93%; 95% CI:90---99%). 38 It is important to highlight that, in both studies, patients had radiologically-confirmed pneumonia and, for that reason, even with a chest's radiograph that confirms CAP diagnostics, it appears to be possible to identify those children who will not benefit from antibiotic use, for example, considering the serum PCT level <0.25 ng/mL. Additionally, IL-6 was independently associated with pneumococcal infection, having a high neg-ative predictive value among children under 5 years of age hospitalized with CAP. 39 To date, there is lack of this information in non-hospitalized children in this age range. Moreover, a combination of biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, C-reactive protein, and interferon -induced protein) was described to be useful in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in hospitalized children; however, less than 200 children were investigated. 40, 41 A common pitfall in this kind of study is how children without bacterial CAP are identified. For example, in a recently published study from Australia, definite bacterial infection was described as clinical empyema and/or bacteria detected in blood or pleural effusion, while presumed viral pneumonia comprised at least one virus detected in the nasopharyngeal swab without criteria for definite bacterial pneumonia. 42 In fact, by using these definitions, the authors grouped cases in two subgroups: the first with invasive bacterial infection and the second without invasive bacterial infection and possible viral infection. The great challenge in grouping CAP cases with bacterial infection is the diagnosis of non-invasive bacterial infection. 43 When the methods employed do not diagnose non-invasive bacterial infection, these patients are mislabeled as cases without bacterial infection. Undoubtedly, the identification and validation of tools to reliably distinguish, among children with CAP, those with viral infection from those with bacterial infection is a priority in the childhood CAP research field. Clinical management requires assessment for defining whether the patient requires hospitalization. By reviewing seven distinct childhood CAP country representative guidelines, it was possible to observe that the criteria recommended for hospital admission differ between developed and developing countries. 44 In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, signs of respiratory distress including tachypnea are indicators for hospitalization, whereas in Brazil, South Africa, and in the WHO guidelines, tachypnea alone is regarded as an indicator for starting antibiotics on an ambulatory basis. 44 In 2012, the WHO made a considerable change in its guideline: for patients with tachypnea and chest indrawing, to whom the formal recommendation was hospitalization, were indicated oral antibiotic outpatient treatment from 2012 onwards. 45 Figures for developed countries prior to the introduction of PCV estimated approximately 2.6 million episodes of CAP, including 1.5 million (58%) children hospitalized for their illness, annually, among children aged <5 years. 46 In contrast, estimates for developing countries were 151 million new episodes annually, 9% of which were associated with hospitalization. 47 It is possible to observe that the proportion of CAP cases associated with hospitalization was 6.4-fold greater in children from developed (58%) when compared with those from developing countries (9%). The difference in proportion of CAP cases that are hospitalized in developing and developed countries likely reflects a combination of physician differences in management, limited access to health care, and differences on healthcare seeking behavior among parents for children, rather than less severe disease among children in developing countries. 44 Furthermore, the health care system structure differs between developing and developed countries. 44 In reality, no published studies from developed countries have systematically compared outcomes of children treated as outpatients with those of hospitalized children according to varying degrees of respiratory distress. 48 Current recommendations from developed countries are based on the assumption that children have reasonable access to healthcare, including evaluation by a doctor. The attending physician's overall assessment of the child's clinical status and the anticipated clinical course are used to determine whether hospitalization is required. 48, 49 Data from four developing countries participants in the GABRIEL study showed that, out of 405 cases aged 2---60 months hospitalized with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia, 13 (3.2%) died; hypoxemia and S. pneumoniae detection by blood PCR were predictors of death and lower chest indrawing along with cyanosis were predictive of hypoxemia; moreover, HMPV and RSV were independently associated with increased risk of hypoxemia. 50 Furthermore, data from 1,802 children between 1 and 59 months old hospitalized with severe or very severe pneumonia and included in the PERCH study, which was conducted in seven low-and middleincome countries between 2011 and 2014, demonstrated that age <1 year, female sex, \\u2265three days of illness prior to presentation to hospital, low weight-for-height, unresponsiveness, deep breathing, hypoxemia, grunting, and absence of cough were predictors of death; these authors also pointed out that the chance of dying increased according to the number of WHO danger signs present: no danger sign (1.5%), one danger sign (10%), and \\u2265two danger signs (33%). 51 Besides that, the number of WHO danger signs at presentation to hospital (c = 0.82) was more accurate than the PERCH-5 stratum score (c = 0.76) or the Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (c = 0.76). 51 Danger signs included central cyanosis or oxygen saturation <90% on pulse oximetry, inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lethargy (or impaired consciousness), and severe respiratory distress. 51 Severe respiratory distress was defined as nasal flaring, grunting or head nodding (use of auxiliary muscles for breathing) in presence of very labored, fast, or gasping breathing, being the child unable to feed because of respiratory distress and tires easily. 52 All in all, inability to drink/feed, vomiting, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, and head nodding have been recognized as reliable and easily detected predictors of death among hospitalized children with CAP, as well as oxygen saturation <90% (hypoxemia). Despite the fact that these findings were based on cases treated in hospital, and therefore it is not possible to infer which cases may have been successfully managed at home, it is possible to recognize that those were evidencebased predictors that can therefore be used in the clinical management of CAP cases across diverse settings, particularly aiding the decision about which patients should be hospitalized for treatment. Another study, conducted in four hospitals in the United States in 2010, recruited 406 children (<18 years old) hospitalized with clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia, aiming to assess whether radiographic findings predict outcomes. Admission radiographs were categorized as single lobar, unilateral, bilateral multilobar, or interstitial pulmonary infiltrate, as well as with absent, small, or moderate/large pleural effusion. The authors reported that findings of moderate/large pleural effusions and bilateral multilobar infiltrates presented the strongest associations with severe disease, and multilobar (either unilateral or bilateral) and interstitial infiltrate were associated with need for intensive care. 53 Thus, the chest X-ray is a valuable tool that contributes to improve the quality of care and may help predict disease severity. 53 There is a general agreement among distinct international guidelines that orally administered amoxicillin is the first line option to treat outpatients, and ampicillin or aqueous penicillin G or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients with CAP in the under-5 years group. 54 Such agreement is based on a general consensus that S. pneumoniae is the most common and dreadful bacterial causative agent in childhood CAP among children under 5 years and therefore it should be the target of antibiotic therapy. 55 For example, S. pneumoniae detection by blood PCR was recently identified as predictor of hypoxemia among children hospitalized with CAP. 50 A systematic review published in 2016 analyzed all randomized clinical trials, published until April 2015, where children with CAP were treated with antibiotics and followed up: 54 studies were included, out of which, 13 evaluated the efficacy of amoxicillin in non-severe nonhospitalized patients and eight evaluated the efficacy of amoxicillin in hospitalized patients. 56 Thus, amoxicillin was the most studied antimicrobial, with the best methodological approach and the most reliable evidence. Two different dose regimens were compared in a clinical trial conducted in Salvador, Brazil: 820 children with non-severe CAP were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin either twice or thrice a day; this was a placebo-controlled, randomized, triple-blinded clinical trial that showed equivalence on the efficacy of both regimens. 57 Thus, the most comfortable and convenient dosage (50 mg/kg/day twice daily) can be used based on science evidence. It is important to recall that the key pharmacodynamics parameter for amoxicillin efficacy is length of time over the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which should be \\u226540%---50% of the dosing interval during treatment of pneumococcal CAP. 58 A pharmacokinetic study compared twice and thrice daily dosing in children receiving 50 mg/kg/day and reported that 91% of the patients had amoxicillin concentrations above 0.5 ug/mL for >50% of the dose interval and 42% had amoxicillin concentrations above 2.0 ug/L for >50% of the dose interval in the twice-daily dose arm. 59 That indicates that the appropriateness of the 50 mg/kg/day dose of amoxicillin needs to be re-evaluated according to the MIC of the pneumococcal strains isolated in the region. For instance, Canadian authors have recently advised against the routine use of higher doses of amoxicillin to treat nonsevere CAP cases in Canada, as only 0.6% of pneumococcal strains presented intermediate resistance (MIC = 4 ug/mL) to amoxicillin. Those authors also argued that the unjustified use of higher doses of amoxicillin leads to increases in costs, side effects, and total antibiotic exposure, and the harmful effects on the patients' microbiome should also be considered. 60 A common practical question is whether macrolides should be given empirically in the first-line option to treat children with CAP; several attempts have been made to address this question. So far, the strongest evidence has been provided by a Brazilian study: 703 children under 5 years with non-severe CAP were given amoxicillin and were prospectively followed-up; amoxicillin was substituted in 3.5% of children diagnosed with acute infection by M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae and in 2.7% of children without this kind of infection (p = 0.6). Three children with acute infection by C. trachomatis did not present therapeutic failure and amoxicillin was the antibiotic used through the entire treatment period. The authors concluded that it was not necessary to treat atypical bacterial infection in every child aged between 2 and 59 months with non-severe CAP; on the contrary, macrolide use could be reserved for those rare cases in which amoxicillin was not effective. 22 A further practical question regards the length of antibiotic therapy. A systematic review published in 2008 evaluated the efficacy of short and long courses of the same antibiotic, in children aged 2---59 months with nonsevere CAP, and identified two clinical trials in which three and five days of amoxicillin use were compared (one in India and another in Pakistan) and one clinical trial where three and five days of co-trimoxazole were compared (in Indonesia and Bangladesh): neither study indicated differences in the efficacy per treatment length. 61 It is of utmost importance to notice that all three studies diagnosed CAP patients according with WHO diagnostics criteria: presence of tachypnea. Evidently, cases of asthma, bronchiolitis, and other lower respiratory tract diseases were included, and the CAP diagnostics was erroneously made in children with other respiratory morbidities. That is why results from studies that diagnosed CAP using WHO criteria should only be generalized for those cases diagnosed in clinical practice with the same criteria, once these results might be different in radiologically-confirmed pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia. 25 In this context, the author highlights an Israeli clinical trial published in 2014: children aged 6---59 months, with radiological finding of alveolar infiltrate on the chest radiograph taken upon admission, temperature \\u226538.5 \\u2022 C, leucocyte total count \\u226515.000 mm 3 , without dangers signs were followed-up daily. The authors first compared three days of treatment with ten days. Due to 33% rate of therapeutic failure in the first arm against none (0%) in the second arm, a preliminary interim analysis switched the duration of treatment in the first arm to five days. At the end, there were 56 and 59 cases treated either with five or ten days of amoxicillin, respectively, without any therapeutic failure. Authors concluded that five days of amoxicillin are enough to treat CAP with alveolar infiltrate, without danger signs or complications. 62 Remarkably, the WHO significantly altered its recommendation in 2012: for children with fast breathing and wheezing, but no chest indrawing, danger signs, nor fever (<38 \\u2022 C), antibiotics should not routinely be recommended, as the cause is most likely viral infection. 45 This was a rupture from the old policy of prescribing antibiotics for any children younger than 5 years old with cough and tachypnea because of the risk of bacterial infection and death, and is due to the recognition that respiratory viruses are major causes of CAP in children, as well as simple clinical signs such as fever and wheeze may preliminarily screen children who are not prone to have bacterial infection. Some notes are advised about antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients for whom ampicillin or aqueous penicillin G or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options. 54 The American guideline states that the third generation cephalosporins could be the first choice only in those places with high prevalence of pneumococcal resistance to penicillin, that is, with MIC \\u22654 ug/mL. 48 It has already been demonstrated that patients infected with pneumococcal strains with MIC up to 4 ug/mL present good response when treated with aqueous penicillin G at dosage of 200.000 UI/kg/day. 63 It has also been shown that the daily dosage of 200.000 UI/kg/day has the same efficacy if given every 4 h or every 6 h. 64 When treatment is managed with a larger interval between doses, it is more comfortable for patients and healthcare professionals, which enhances adherence, besides being cheaper for healthcare institutions. It is also relevant to comment on how hospitalized patients with CAP evolve during antibiotic treatment. Another Brazilian study included 154 hospitalized children older than 2 months of age with radiologically-confirmed CAP, all treated with aqueous penicillin G (200.000 UI/kg/day) and penicillin was substituted in 26 (18%) cases due to deterioration of clinical status. Among the 128 remaining cases that received aqueous penicillin G throughout the treatment period, tachypnea, fever and chest indrawing were still present after 48 h of antibiotic therapy in 51.0%, 26.8%, and 10.3% of the cases, respectively; those symptoms were present at 120 h after treatment onset in 33.3%, 10.3%, and 2.2% of the cases, respectively. 65 Notably, all patients presented a full recovery and were discharged from hospital with oral amoxicillin replacing aqueous penicillin G for home completion of antimicrobial therapy. These numbers show that patients may have a slow recovery, suggesting that there is no need of antibiotic replacement if the patient does not present clinical/radiological deterioration. Therefore, the use of ceftriaxone in cases with very severe disease or the association of oxacillin or macrolide should occur in specific situations, where it is possible to assume the presence of high penicillin resistant pneumococcus, or \\u2424-lactamase producing H. influenzae (ceftriaxone indication), or Staphylococcus aureus (oxacillin indication), or even atypical bacteria (macrolide indication). 54 Patients under 2 months of age should be hospitalized and receive intravenous antibiotics once they have higher chance of dying from CAP, regardless of other factors when compared with children older than 2 months. 66 In this age stratum, group B streptococcus, Gram-negative intestinal bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, and S. pneumoniae are potential causative agents. 67, 68 Then, antibiotic therapy in this age group includes administration of either intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) ampicillin associated with amynoglycosides throughout the whole treatment and from 1-week-old upwards, it is possible to substitute amynoglycosides for third-generation cephalosporins. 69 If age is <1 month, cefotaxime is the first choice drug, considering hyperbilirubinemia and prematurity. Ceftriaxone increases the risk of kernicterus in these patients, once it has high avidity to serum proteins, especially albumin, which bonds to bilirubin. 70 C. trachomatis should be suspected in the presence of conjunctivitis. In this case, the recommended antibiotic choice is erythromycin. 54 A few comments about corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy should be made. A Spanish study was performed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Sixty children, aged from 1 month to 14 years, with CAP and pleural effusion were included. Those authors described faster recovery rate, measured objectively in hours, in the group that received dexamethasone (DXM) 0.15 mg/kg, every 6 h, for 48 h, plus cefotaxime, when compared with the control group. There were no significant differences in adverse events attributable to the study drugs, except for hyperglycemia. Therefore, the authors concluded that DXM appeared to be a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for decreasing the time to recovery in children with parapneumonic pleural effusion. 71 Another study included children with severe CAP: 29 patients received a 5-day methylprednisolone course plus imipenem and 30 patients received imipenem plus placebo. The authors reported that the methylprednisolone group had a faster resolution of symptoms. 72 A recent systematic review identified four randomized controlled trials that included 310 children; corticosteroids reduced early clinical failure rates (RR 0.41 [95% CI: 0.24---0.70]; high-quality evidence) based on two small, clinically heterogeneous trials, and reduced time to clinical cure. 73 To date, the role of corticosteroids in adjunctive chemical therapy of childhood CAP is yet to be established. Further support is needed to recommend the use of corticosteroids in clinical practice across distinct severity subgroups and in association with different antibiotics, especially \\u2424-lactams. 54 CAP is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children aged under-5 years, worldwide. Currently, respiratory viruses are being recognized as major causative agents. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation \\u226496%) and increased work of breathing are the most associated signs with CAP. In regard to severity assessment, danger signs (inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation <90%) have been recognized as predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. The first line option for antibiotic treatment comprises oral amoxicillin for outpatients and ampicillin or aqueous penicillin G or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) for inpatients. Future investigations should prioritize the identification and validation of tools to distinguish among children with CAP those with viral infection from those with bacterial infection.

Many microorganisms are associated with pneumonia, and now attention is turning to the importance of viruses as pathogens. Widespread introduction of Haemophilus infl uenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines into immunisation programmes has led to speculation about the growing predominance of viruses as causes of childhood pneumonia. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian infl uenza A (H5N1) virus, and the 2009 pandemic infl uenza A (H1N1) virus has re-emphasised the important role of respiratory viruses as causes of severe pneumonia. New respiratory viruses-such as human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and human bocavirus-have been discovered during the past decade. Importantly, the availability of molecular diagnostic assays (such as PCR) has greatly increased our ability to detect and characterise the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections. Findings of previous studies, in which conventional virological diagnostic techniques were used, have most likely underestimated the role of viruses as pneumonia pathogens. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] In this Seminar, we review viral communityacquired pneumonia in immunocompetent children and adults, focusing on studies that have used modern molecular diagnostic techniques. According to WHO estimates, 450 million cases of pneumonia are recorded every year; about 4 million people die from this illness, accounting for 7% of total mortality of 57 million people. 6, 7 The highest incidences arise in children younger than 5 years and in adults older than 75 years (fi gure 1). 8 In developing countries, incidence could be fi ve times higher than in developed regions. In children, 156 million episodes of pneumonia are recorded annually, of which 151 million are present in developing countries. 6, 7 In 2008, 1\\u00b76 million children younger than 5 years died from pneumonia. 9 5 million cases of childhood community-acquired pneumonia are reported yearly in developed countries, but mortality has declined strikingly and is now very rare. In a Canadian study, 25 319 admissions for childhood pneumonia took place during the 9-year study period; 11 deaths were recorded and only one death did not have a comorbid condition. 10 Mortality of 1\\u00b72 per million previously healthy young adults has been recorded in the UK. 11 In the USA alone, the economic burden of community-acquired pneumonia has been estimated to be more than US$17 billion annually. 12  Laboratory diagnosis of viral pneumonia has relied on detection of virus or viral antigen in upper-respiratory specimens (eg, nasopharyngeal aspirates) and lowerrespiratory samples (eg, induced sputum) by culture or immunofl uorescence microscopy, and on measurement We searched PubMed for original research, reviews, and commentaries, with the terms \\\"pneumonia and children/ adults\\\", \\\"pneumonia and aetiology\\\", \\\"viral pneumonia\\\", \\\"pneumonia and viruses\\\", and names of specifi c respiratory viruses and pneumonia. No date or language restrictions were included. We paid special attention to reports published since 2000 when molecular diagnostics were introduced. We also searched our personal database of references gathered over the past 15 years and manually scanned references from selected reports and from selected authors. of antibodies in paired serum samples. Introduction of PCR has increased the ability to detect respiratory viruses, including those that are diffi cult to culture. At least 26 viruses have now been associated with communityacquired pneumonia (panel). Despite technological advances, establishing the cause of pneumonia remains challenging. 13 Specimens from the lower-respiratory tract can be hard to obtain, and distinguishing possible prolonged shedding or colonisation from infection can be diffi cult. For diagnosis of viral pneumonia, reliance on testing of nasopharyngeal specimens presents its own challenges; detection of a virus in the nasopharynx could represent coincidental upper-respiratory infection or a pneumonia pathogen. Measurement of background prevalence of asymptomatic nasopharyngeal viral infection in a control group might help to clarify the size of this diagnostic issue at a population level, but this approach has been used only rarely in aetiological studies. Furthermore, most research has focused on patients admitted to hospital and, therefore, fi ndings might not be representative of mildto-moderate disease. Several diff erent types of specimen from the upper and lower airway have been used in aetiological studies of community-acquired pneumonia, including: nasopharyngeal aspirates or washes; swabs from the nasopharynx, nose, or throat; combined nasopharygeal and throat swabs; expectorated and induced sputum; tracheal aspirates; bronchoalveolar lavage; and lung puncture. 14, 15 Recovery of virus fl uctuates according to specimen type, which probably accounts for some of the variability of fi ndings between studies. Most studies of the cause of viral pneumonia have used upper-respiratory specimens to test for viruses. In children, nasopharyngeal aspirates are generally deemed the specimen of choice because both nasal and nasopharyngeal mucus samples are gathered. Respiratory viruses have been noted in 95% of mucus samples obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration from children with respiratory infection. 16 Obtaining an aspirate is, however, unpleasant and requires a suction device. Nasal swabs taken with a sterile cotton swab from a depth of 2-3 cm have comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates for culture of all major respiratory viruses, except respiratory syncytial virus. 17 Flocked swabs with nylon fi bres in a perpendicular fashion are now preferred by many clinicians because they are convenient to use and have a similar sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates for detection by PCR of respiratory viruses. 15, 17, 18 In adults, nasopharyngeal swabs have a higher sensitivity than throat swabs, but they can be less sensitive than nasopharyngeal washes. 14 Transnasal nasopharyngeal fl ocked swabs also have high virus detection rates in adults. 19, 20 Lower-respiratory specimens have obvious advantages for establishing the cause of pneumonia because they come from the site of infection. However, obtaining reliable specimens that are not contaminated by fl ora from the upper airway is diffi cult. Induced sputum specimens have been used in paediatric pneumonia studies, although assuring that the specimens are representative of the lower-respiratory tract can be challenging. 21 High-quality specimens can be obtained by thoracic needle aspiration, but this technique has not been adopted widely because of safety concerns, despite a low complication rate. 22, 23 In general, PCR-based methods are between two and fi ve times more sensitive than conventional virus diagnostic methods (culture, antigen detection, and serological assays) for detection of respiratory viruses. This benefi t applies particularly to adults and elderly people, who might have a smaller nasopharyngeal viral load than children. 24, 25 Moreover, some respiratory viruses can only be detected readily by PCR. Development of several multiplex assays has enabled simultaneous detection of up to 15 diff erent viruses, and use of these tests is becoming standard for identifi cation of respiratory viruses. 26, 27 The ability to diff erentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia could have important management implications. Despite advances, diagnostic tests still fail to identify causative agents in many aff ected individuals. 28 As a result, other variables have been used to distinguish viral from bacterial pneumonia (table 1) . However, no clinical algorithm exists to discern clearly the cause of pneumonia. This absence is perhaps not surprising in view of the probable important interaction between viruses and bacteria in pathogenesis of pneumonia. Respiratory viruses usually follow seasonal patterns of activity and are most likely to cause pneumonia during those times. Epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus typically happen every or every other year in late autumn, rhinovirus epidemics arise in autumn and spring, whereas infl uenza peaks are seen during late autumn and early winter. Several viruses can be co-circulating at specifi c times of the year, even during the highest epidemic peaks of one virus. 29 Although viral pneumonia is being recognised increasingly in adults, it still seems to be most typical in children, especially in infants younger than 2 years. 30 According to the British Thoracic Society, fever higher than 38\\u00b75\\u00b0C, a respiratory rate greater than 50 breaths per min, and chest recession are suggestive of bacterial rather than viral pneumonia; by comparison, young age, wheezing, fever less than 38\\u00b75\\u00b0C, and striking chest recession are suggestive of a viral cause. 1 However, clinical signs and symptoms of viral and bacterial pneumonia are highly variable and overlap; there fore, they cannot be relied on. Importantly, typical pneumococcal pneumonia (sudden onset, high fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, lobar infi ltrates, leucocytosis) is only one part of the range of bacterial pneumonia. 31 White-blood-cell count and concentrations in serum of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin are variables studied widely in children and adults with community-acquired pneumonia. In general, these biomarkers are raised signifi cantly in individuals with bacterial pneumonia compared with patients with viral pneumonia (table 1), 19,32-35 although none has suffi cient sensitivity or specifi city to be used in isolation. Use of procalcitonin in clinical practice to identify bacterial infection and help guide antimicrobial treatment has been the focus of many studies. This substance increases within 6-12 h after onset of bacterial infection and halves daily when infection is controlled. 34 In the context of pneumonia, concentrations of procalcitonin greater than 0\\u00b75 \\u03bcg/L support bacterial infection, whereas repeatedly low amounts suggest that bacterial infection is unlikely. However, the exact role of procalcitonin in management of pneumonia is still the subject of ongoing discussion and debate. 35 Recommendations from the American Thoracic Society are that diagnosis of pneumonia should be made on the basis of chest radiography. 36 Interstitial infi ltrates on chest radiographs are generally believed to suggest a viral cause of pneumonia and alveolar infi ltrates to indicate a bacterial cause (fi gure 2). However, bacteria and viruses alone or together can induce a broad range of chest radiographic changes, and alterations are only helpful in specifi c cases to confi rm a microbial cause of pneumonia. In one study, bacterial infection was noted in 97 (71%) of 137 children with alveolar infi ltrates, whereas 97 (72%) of 134 with bacterial pneumonia had alveolar infi ltrates. 33 In children with viral pneumonia, 40 (49%) had alveolar changes. Of 85 children with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia, alveolar infi ltrates were recorded in 77 (91%) and interstitial infi ltrates alone in eight (9%). 37 Multilobe disease in various cases of viral pneumonia was reported in half of 88 adults with community-acquired pneumonia. 19 Thoracic CT indicated tree-bud opacities, multifocal consolidations, and ground-glass opacities in adults with viral pneumonia without any evidence of possible concomitant bacterial infection; however, a viral cause was never suggested by the radiologists. 38 Intuitively, bacterial pneumonia should respond to appropriate antibacterial treatment but viral pneumonia should not. In a study of 153 children admitted with community-acquired pneumonia, median duration of fever was 14 h after onset of antibiotic treatment. 39 No diff erence was recorded between those diagnosed with viral and bacterial pneumonia. However, children with mixed viral and bacterial infections became afebrile over a longer period. Undetected bacterial co-infection probably accounts for the response to antibacterial treatment in patients with apparent viral pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia is a dynamic situation. Biomarkers and infi ltrates on chest radiographs are only snapshots of this active state. Findings of follow-up studies, after 12-24 h, might be totally diff erent. We identifi ed nine studies of community-acquired pneumonia (n=4279 episodes) in which the viral cause had been searched for by PCR. In most of these investigations, virus culture and antigen detection were also used. 21, 30, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] Seven studies were undertaken in developed countries and two in developing countries. Evidence of viral infection was recorded in 49% (range 43-67) of cases. Prevalence of community-acquired pneumonia associated with respiratory syncytial virus (11%), infl uenza viruses (10%), parainfl uenza viruses (8%), and adenovirus (3%) was similar to that reported in studies in which only conventional diagnostic approaches were used. 1,2 Exact numbers of diff erent viruses are diffi cult to compare from one study to another because several techniques were applied. When serological assays alone were used, evidence of a viral cause was obtained in 20-43% of children with community-acquired pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus was dominant. 47-50 PCR has increased detection of rhinoviruses (18%) and enteroviruses (7%). Of newly described viruses, human bocavirus was recorded in 5% of cases and human metapneumovirus in 8%. Coronaviruses were seen in 22 (7%) of 338 children in one study. 41 In a 3-year prospective study in Finland, the overall probable cause of pneumonia was recorded in 85% of children, with bacterial infection in 53% and viral infection in 62%. 30 The most comprehensive study from a virological perspective searched for 14 viruses in 338 children with pneumonia over a 2-year period. 41 Prevalence of viral infection was 67%, with respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, human bocavirus, human meta pneumo virus, and parainfl uenza viruses being the most common agents. Many researchers have focused on the role of single respiratory viruses as a cause of childhood communityacquired pneumonia or have studied sole virus infections and looked for pneumonia in their clinical profi les (table 2) . Globally, respiratory syncytial virus continues to be the major causative viral agent of pneumonia in children and could be the predominant viral cause of severe pneumonia in this population. 52, 53 With the advent of PCR techniques, rhinoviruses have been detected increasingly in childhood pneumonia. 54 infections in children admitted to hospital has been reported in seven studies, 55-61 and 11-53% had pneumonia. However, the role of rhinoviruses in pneumonia is still questioned because of the frequent detection of rhinoviruses in asymptomatic individuals (mean prevalence 15%), strikingly more than for other respiratory viruses (prevalence 1-5%). 62 Jartti and colleagues suggested that PCR is likely to detect a true but asymptomatic infection. 62 A diffi culty with rhinoviruses is the paucity of serological tests to verify acute infection. In immunocompetent individuals, rhinoviral clearance after symptomatic infection is rapid (average 1-3 weeks). 18 Pneumonia was diagnosed in 10% of children admitted with acute human metapneumovirus respiratory infection, [63] [64] [65] [66] with the highest prevalence (44%) in infants younger than 12 months. 66 It has also been recorded in 11-75% of children with human bocavirus infection. 67 In a study from Thailand of infants younger than 5 years admitted with pneumonia, human bocavirus was the third most prevalent agent detected, after rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, accounting for 12% of all cases. 68 Although the role of human bocavirus in pneumonia is still being clarifi ed, serological evidence suggests it is a cause of human infection. With a novel IgM and IgG enzyme immunoassay, 96% of children with a high load of human bocavirus in nasopharyngeal aspirates and 92% of wheezy children with viraemia had diagnostic seroresponses. 69 Human bocavirus was identifi ed serologically in 12 (12%) of 101 children with community-acquired pneumonia in Italy. 70 Although prevalence of adenovirus-associated pneumonia is fairly low (range 2-12%), this type of infection is important to recognise because it might induce severe and fatal necrotising pneumonia (especially serotypes 3, 7, and 14). 30, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] 71 In China, adenovirus DNA was detected in 9% of post-mortem pulmonary tissue specimens from 175 children with fatal pneumonia. 72 Of note, PCR is substantially more sensitive for identifi cation of adenovirus than is antigen detection. 73 Human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, and newly discovered types NL63 and HKU1, have been linked to community-acquired pneumonia in children. 74, 75 Infection with human coronavirus was detected in 3% of children and adolescents in a large pneumonia study in Thailand. 76  We identifi ed ten studies of adults with communityacquired pneumonia (n=2910 episodes) in which PCR was used to test for respiratory viruses. Evidence of viral infection was detected in 22% of cases. 19, 20, [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] In most of these studies, a comprehensive array of conventional virological methods were also implemented to better defi ne the role of viruses in adults with communityacquired pneumonia. Similar to fi ndings of paediatric studies, prevalence of infection with infl uenza viruses (8%), respiratory syncytial virus (3%), parainfl uenza viruses (2%), and adenovirus (2%) is comparable with values recorded with conventional diagnostic methods alone. 5, 36 Serological techniques only were used in four studies; evidence of viral community-acquired pneumonia was noted in 10-23% of patients. [86] [87] [88] [89] Use of PCR has augmented detection of viruses that are diffi cult to identify with conventional methods, including rhinoviruses (6%), human coronaviruses (5%), and human metapneumovirus (1%). As a result, overall prevalence of respiratory viral infection in PCR studies (15-56%) is generally higher than for studies in which PCR was not implemented. With a full set of tests, fi ndings of three reports suggest that a third of adult cases of community-acquired pneumonia are associated with viral infection. 19, 20, 85 Other researchers have focused on the role of specifi c respiratory viruses in adults with community-acquired pneumonia. Respiratory syncytial virus is recognised increasingly as a cause of illness in adults, 90 and roughly 2-9% of elderly patients admitted with pneumonia in the USA have infection associated with this virus. 91 Infections with respiratory syncytial virus are linked to substantial mortality. 92 Several outbreaks of severe respiratory disease (including fatal pneumonia) in elderly residents of nursing homes have been associated with rhinoviruses. 93, 94 Adenoviruses have been implicated in 90% of pneumoniarelated admissions in basic military trainees. 95 An outbreak of pneumonia associated with adenovirus serotype 14 has been reported. 96 When searched for systematically, coronaviruses have been detected in samples from a small proportion (2-6%) of adults with pneumonia. 76, 97 These patients had clinical illnesses indistinguishable from those in individuals with community-acquired pneumonia associated with other micro organisms. 2% of asymptomatic controls also had human coronavirus infection. 76 Infections with human metapneumovirus arise throughout adulthood. Outbreaks of this viral infection associated with fatal outcome have been reported from long-term care facilities. 98, 99 Of patients admitted with human metapneumovirus infection, 27% had chest radiographic infi ltrates, 12% required ventilatory support, and 7% died. 100 Human bocavirus is an uncommon cause of pneumonia in adults. As part of a surveillance project in Thailand, this virus was detected in fi ve (1%) of 667 adults (age 20 years or older) admitted with pneumonia and in one of 126 (1%) controls without febrile or respiratory illness. 68 During 2002 and 2003, the SARS coronavirus caused severe respiratory infection in more than 8000 people and led to 774 deaths. Up to a third of patients with SARS became critically ill. Pneumonia with lung injury arose in about 16% of all individuals infected with the virus and in 80% of critically ill patients. By contrast with other viral pneumonias, children were fairly well protected from severe illness. 101 Since November, 2003, avian infl uenza A (H5N1) virus has caused more than 450 human infections, with a case-fatality proportion of about 60%. Multiorgan failure usually develops within 1 week from onset of illness, with lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and raised concentrations of aminotransferase and creatinine. Almost all patients with avian infl uenza develop pneumonia. Cause of death is most typically progressive respiratory failure. 102 Since March, 2009, pandemic infl uenza A (H1N1) virus has spread in more than 200 countries over the world, causing about 18 000 deaths. In the USA alone, more than 59 million people have been infected. 103 In Australia, the rate of admission was 23 per 100 000 population. Critical illness arose most commonly in adults with a median age of 40 years and has been rare in those older than 65 years. [103] [104] [105] Half of patients with critical illness had viral pneumonitis or acute respiratory distress syndrome. 103, 106 In Germany, pneumonia was diagnosed in 275 (0\\u00b77%) of 40 729 patients with pandemic H1N1 virus infection; half of these were admitted. 107 In the UK, 102 (29%) of 349 patients with chest radiographs had fi ndings consistent with pneumonia. Median age of patients with pneumonia was 26 years. 108 Poor outcomes from H1N1 virus infection have been recorded in pregnant women, indigenous populations, and individuals with substantial obesity or serious comorbidities. Chest radiographic infi ltrates in SARS, H5N1, and H1N1 infections were most usually interstitial, patchy, and bilateral. 109 In 1997, Drews and colleagues 110 reviewed eight studies of a total of 1341 cases of respiratory viral infection detected mostly with conventional techniques. These researchers noted dual viral infection in 67 (5%) cases. Detection of several viruses in a fairly high proportion of cases has been a feature of pneumonia aetiological studies in which PCR was used. In particular, for childhood pneumonia, two or three viruses have been detected in 10-20% of children. 21, 30, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] Specifi cally, human bocavirus is detected frequently in association with other respiratory viruses. [67] [68] [69] In a Thai pneumonia study, 40 (91%) of 44 children younger than 5 years with human bocavirus infections had co-infection with other viruses. 68 The combination of human bocavirus and rhinovirus was the most typical dual infection. In a comprehensive virological study of childhood pneumonia, two or more viruses were detected in 61 (18%) of 338 pneumonia episodes, and three viruses were recorded in nine cases. 41 Human bocavirus was associated with other viruses in 33 (69%) of 48 episodes, followed by infl uenza viruses (13/25; 52%) and respiratory syncytial virus (34/67; 51%). In another study, 64% of children with human bocavirus infection and co-infection with another virus had serological evidence of acute human bocavirus infection. 69 The clinical relevance of detection of several viruses in pneumonia, and the association with severe illness, is uncertain. [111] [112] [113] Viral-viral interaction in vivo is poorly understood. Viruses might interact indirectly or directly, resulting in complementation or inhibition. Children with pneumonia caused by co-infection with human bocavirus and other viruses have more wheezing than with viral pneumonia associated with a sole pathogen. 69 In one study, viral co-infections were associated with more severe pneumonia than were single infections, when rates of admission were looked at. 41 Interest has grown with respect to the interaction of bacteria and viruses in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Evidence from cell culture, ecological, post-mortem, and clinical studies support this area of interest. A favoured hypothesis is that viral infection is followed by secondary bacterial infection. Researchers who reassessed data from the infl uenza pandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968 have suggested that most deaths during these periods probably resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia. 114 This fi nding contrasts with avian H5N1-associated pneumonia, which seems to be a primarily viral infection. 102 In patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection, secondary bacterial infection developed in 4-24% of cases. 103, 106, 115 Evidence of probable mixed viral-bacterial infection has been recorded in up to 45% of cases of communityacquired pneumonia in children. 21, 30, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] Not surprisingly, the most typical combination is Streptococcus pneumoniae with various respiratory viruses. In developing countries, both viruses and bacteria have been detected directly in lung aspirate samples from children with pneumonia. 22 In a study from The Gambia, 45 of 74 children had evidence of pneumococcal communityacquired pneumonia and 15 (33%) of these also had evidence of a respiratory virus infection, shown by virus culture or serological tests. 116 In a study from Nigeria, 117 virological analysis was done in 122 children with community-acquired pneumonia. 61 (50%) had evidence of viral infection and, of those, ten (16%) also had blood cultures positive for bacteria, most usually Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, ten (16%) of 62 cases with measles-associated community-acquired pneumonia had bacteraemia. 117 Mixed viral-bacterial infections in adults with community-acquired pneumonia seem to be reported less frequently than those in children. 19, 20, [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] In one study, both viral and bacterial pathogens were noted in 35 (14%) of 242 cases. 84 In another investigation, evidence of mixed viral and bacterial infections was reported in 45 (15%) of 304 patients (median age 70 years). The most frequent combinations were rhinovirus plus Strep pneumoniae and infl uenza A plus Strep pneumoniae. 19 Undoubtedly, detection of several pathogens will be noted more frequently as more elaborate diagnostic tests are used as part of pneumonia aetiological studies. Presuming that viral infection precedes bacterial infection, we are likely to continue underestimating the true incidence of viralbacterial co-infection because of diffi culties detecting the earlier infection. Evidence, albeit sparse, suggests that mixed infections could induce a more severe infl ammatory and clinical disease than individual bacterial or viral infections. 19, 84, 118 Concomitant infl uenza virus and Staph aureus infection can cause severe fatal pneumonia in children and adults. [119] [120] [121] Moreover, in one pneumonia study, half of children with treatment failure had evidence of mixed viral-bacterial infection. 39 Similarly, in adults, rhinoviruspneumococcal and infl uenza-bacterial pneumonia co-infections are associated with severe pneumonia and raised mortality. 19, 84, 121 Detection of Strep pneumoniae in the nasopharynx of patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection predicted severe disease outcome. 122 Post-mortem studies provide direct evidence for a viral cause of pneumonia and descriptions of characteristics of lung histopathology. Many diff erent respiratory viruses have been detected in lung tissue in case reports or in larger series. In 200 children who died from serious respiratory infections in Brazil, use of immunohistochemical techniques aided detection of viruses in lung tissue from 53 (34%) with bronchopneumonia and 18 (42%) with interstitial pneumonitis, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus, infl uenza A and B viruses, adenovirus, and parainfl uenza viruses types 1, 2, and 3. 123 In another study from Mexico, PCR detected respiratory syncytial virus in lung tissue from 29 (30%) of 98 children who died from pneumonia. 124 Of archived lung tissue from 175 children who died of pneumonia in south China, 20 samples had adenovirus detected by PCR or by immunohistochemistry. 72 Rhinovirus infection of the lung has also been shown by histopathology. 125 The nature of histopathological changes in viral pneumonia varies, possibly an indication of diff erences in viral infections and comorbidity. Generally, interstitial pneumonitis with lymphocytic infi ltrations is seen in viral pneumonitis. 123 In fatal cases of pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus infection, post-mortem evidence shows infection of both bronchial and alveolar epithelium. 126 Most cells around the bronchioles and in the alveolar interstitium were alveolar macrophages and monocytes, and CD3positive lymphocytes were also seen frequently around bronchioles. In rhinovirus pneumonia, hyperplasia and desquamation of alveolar-lining cells and immunohistochemical localisation of rhinoviral antigen in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages were seen. 125 In fatal cases of human metapneumovirus pneumonia, pathological analysis indicated bilateral haemorrhagic bronchopneumonia. 127 Histopathological fi ndings in fatal cases of SARS and avian H5N1 infection are quite similar and have been characterised by diff use alveolar damage, desquamation of pneumocytes, oedema, and hyaline-membrane formation. 128, 129 Diff use alveolar damage has also been recorded in the lungs of people who died of 2009 pandemic H1N1 infections (fi gure 3). Furthermore, necrotising bronchiolitis, diff use alveolar damage with alveolar haemorrhage, alveolar septal oedema, hyaline membranes, hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes, and necrosis of bronchiolar walls have been noted. 130, 131 Histopathological evidence of bacterial co-infection was reported in 29 of 100 fatal H1N1 cases. 132 Do all patients with community-acquired pneumonia, including those with evidence of viral infection, need to be treated with antibiotics? To date, no clear consensus exists on this issue. Some experts recommend that all patients with pneumonia should receive antibiotic treatment, because exclusion of the presence of bacterial infection is impossible. Recommendations of the British Thoracic Society are that antibiotic treatment can be withheld in young children with mild illness in whom viral infection is likely. 1 As far as we know, only one randomised placebo-controlled study has been done to investigate the need for antibiotic treatment in childhood community-acquired pneumonia. 133 In 136 children, no clinically signifi cant effi cacy of antibiotics was recorded. Most study children had fairly mild disease and the investigation was undertaken during an epidemic of respiratory syncytial virus, so most participants probably had pneumonia caused by this virus. Further randomised placebo-controlled trials of antibiotic treatment for pneumonia are unlikely to happen because of ethical concerns. Opportunities are currently limited in clinical practice for use of antivirals in the treatment of pneumonia (table 3) . 134 Neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, were developed during the 1990s and now have established roles in early treatment of infl uenza A and B infections. In children and adults, neuraminidase inhibitors reduce median time to resolution of symptoms by 0\\u00b75-2\\u00b75 days when administered within 48 h of onset of symptoms. 135 Importantly, early use of neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce development of complications such as pneumonia. 136 The Infectious Diseases Society of America extends treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors to admitted infl uenza patients whose onset of symptoms is more than 48 h before presentation. 137 Selection of the most appropriate antiviral to treat infl uenza should be made on the basis of relevant susceptibility data. Before emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, the seasonal H1N1 virus developed resistance to oseltamivir, and treatment with either zanamivir or amantadine or rimantidine was recommended, whereas the seasonal H3N2 virus was resistant to amantadine and rimantidine. If subtype information is unavailable, zanamivir or a combination of oseltamivir and rimantadine is recommended. 137 The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus remains susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, and oseltamivir has been used widely for treatment of pneumonia caused by this virus. Although resistance to oseltamivir has been reported in people with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus infection, it has been largely restricted to immunocompromised individuals. 103 All isolates are still susceptible to zanamivir. Intravenous use of peramivir or zanamivir could be lifesaving in critically ill patients with infl uenza. 138, 139 Experience with antivirals for community-acquired pneumonia caused by viruses other than infl uenza is scarce, with existing knowledge mainly from case reports and some treatment studies in immunosuppressed patients. Ribavirin has a broad antiviral range, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfl uenza and infl uenza viruses. 140 Effi cacy of ribavirin aerosol treatment for bronchiolitis and pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus infection is modest at best. Intravenous ribavirin could be considered for treatment of severe pneumonia caused by infection with respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, or parainfl uenza virus, on the basis of experience in immunosuppressed patients. 141 New antiviral agents are in development for respiratory syncytial virus infection, including small interfering RNAs. 142 In several case studies of immunocompromised patients, clinical effi cacy of cidofovir has been shown for severe adenovirus pneumonia. 143 Cidofovir should be considered for treatment of new adenovirus subtype 14 pneumonia. Researchers reported successful manage ment of human metapneumovirus pneumonia with a combination of intravenous ribavirin and immuno globulin. 144 Varicella pneumonia should be treated with aciclovir. 145 Use of corticosteroids for treatment of viral communityacquired pneumonia is controversial and can vary according to the causative virus. The ineff ectiveness of these agents for treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infections is well established. 146 For management of SARS, inconclusive results were reported in 26 treatment studies, and possible harm was indicated in four trials. 147 High-dose corticosteroids were administered to a third of patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus infection, 148 but use of these agents is not recommended because of prolonged viral shedding in seasonal infl uenza and increased mortality in avian H5N1 and, possibly, 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus infections. 103 On the other hand, some data suggest that corticosteroids can augment outcome of pneumonia caused by infection with varicella-zoster virus (in combination with aciclovir) and hantavirus. 149 Possibilities to prevent viral community-acquired pneumonia are limited. Infl uenza vaccines have been used since the mid 1940s and they now have an established role in prevention of infl uenza A and B virus infections. Importantly, inactivated infl uenza vaccine is eff ective in young children, including those younger than 2 years. 150 During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a monovalent vaccine against the virus was developed. 103 Its active use could have played a part in the course of the initial pandemic wave in some countries-eg, in Finland, only 44 fatal cases were recorded. In addition to vaccines, infl uenza A and B virus infections can be prevented by prophylactic use of neuraminidase inhibitors. 137 Severe respiratory syncytial virus infections in high-risk neonates have been prevented successfully with palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, which is administered during a respiratory syncytial virus epidemic. 151 This agent has been shown to prevent admissions related to respiratory syncytial virus by 50% in premature infants. Since the 1960s, several types of vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus have been developed without success. Live-attenuated vaccines produced by reverse genetics are now in clinical studies. 142 Pneumonia caused by adenovirus types 4 and 7 has been prevented in military trainees by an oral vaccine, with 95% effi cacy. Unfortunately, confl ict over the manufacturing process stopped production in 1996. 95 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was shown to prevent a third of viral pneumonia cases in a study in South Africa, most probably by prevention of superimposed bacterial co-infections. 152 Despite many advances, further studies are still needed to better understand the role of viruses in the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Increased availability of molecular diagnostic methods enables us to evaluate our understanding of viral pneumonia and to reassess all existing dogma. Further clarifi cation is needed of the role of bacterial-viral interaction in the pathogenesis of pneumonia and of the importance of viruses as pneumonia pathogens in the world after widespread implementation of H infl uenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Also, examination of regional diff erences in causes of pneumonia is needed urgently, particularly to obtain additional data from developing countries. Detailed understanding of the viral cause of community-acquired pneumonia will guide antiviral drug and vaccine developments. \", \"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness that affects millions of people each year, and it is one of the most common infectious diseases that can lead to morbidity and mortality worldwide. The Global Burden of Disease Study reported that lower respiratory tract infection remains the second largest cause of death and years of life lost in 2013. 1 CAP is a disease that is diagnosed by clinical, epidemiological, radiographic and laboratory characteristics, and the clinician usually relies on empirical evidence when determining therapy, which can lead to antibiotic abuse. Therefore, the detection of respiratory pathogens is very important for the clinician to be able to treat CAP. Pathogens called bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause pneumonia. In adults, bacterial pneumonia has been extensively studied, but viral pneumonia is not as well understood. With the help of new diagnostic technologies, viral respiratory tract infections are being identified as common etiologies of CAP. In adults, approximately 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year, and 15-56% of CAP cases are associated with RVIs. 2, 3 We designed this study to identify pathogens, including common pneumonia-causing bacteria, viruses and atypical pathogens, by multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The respiratory etiological surveillance monitoring system of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) of Beijing is designed to monitor respiratory pathogens in Beijing. Peking University Third hospital is a sentinel hospital responsible for routine surveillance of respiratory tract infections. We conducted a retrospective study of outpatients through routine surveillance with CAP from June 2017 to February 2019 in a fever clinic. The patients were enrolled according to the following criteria. CAP was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of Chinese adult community-acquired pneumonia (2016 edition), developed by the Chinese Society of Respiratory Medicine: (1) fever (a body temperature >38.0\\u00b0C) or hypothermia (a body temperature <35.5\\u00b0C); (2) leukocytosis (a white blood cell count >10,000/ml) or leukopenia (a white blood cell count <4000/ml); (3) signs/symptoms of cough, sputum, respiratory symptom aggravation (with or without purulent sputum), chest pain, dyspnea and hemoptysis; (4) chest radiological imaging features such as patchy infiltration, leaf segment consolidation shadow, and interstitial inflammation change (with or without pleural effusion); and (5) signs of lung consolidation or rales on lung auscultation. CAP can be established when excluding tuberculosis, pulmonary tumor, noninfectious pulmonary interstitial disease, pulmonary edema, pulmonary atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary eosinophil infiltration and pulmonary vasculitis. Detailed demographic information was documented, and laboratory data were collected from the patients' medical files. We collected sputum, or throat swabs if there was no sputum, from patients diagnosed with CAP. Specimens were transported to the CDC laboratory for the pathogen nucleic acid amplification test by RT-PCR for 20 pathogens, including 9 viruses, 3 atypical pathogens and 8 bacteria. The pathogens were human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza A virus (IFA), influenza B virus (IFB), human coronavirus (HCoV) (229E/HKU1 and OC43/NL63), adenoviruses (ADVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), enteroviruses (EVs), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Pyogenic streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. All analyses were performed with Statistical 19.0 and Microsoft Excel 2007. General data are presented as a percentage (P) or mean \\u00b1 SD. Differences in categorical variables between groups were compared using the \\u03c72 test. A single-tailed P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. . The housekeeping gene RNaseP was used as the internal standard in the multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay. There were positive and negative controls in the RT-PCR Taq kit. In the detection kit for the respiratory viruses, positive controls were the artificially synthesized virus RNA with target sequences, and negative controls were RNasefree and DNase-free water. In the detection kit for the respiratory bacteria, positive controls were the bacterial pathogens and RNaseP of target sequence plasmids, and negative controls were RNase-free and DNase-free water. 3. Results determination: The following conditions should be simultaneously met: 1. sleek S-Curve; 2. CT \\u226435 3; 3. \\u0394Rn\\uff1e1\\u00d710 4 . 4. Limits of detection for the different pathogens: In the detection kit for the respiratory viruses, when the viral nucleic acid <10 3 in the reaction system, it may not be detected. Although the target sequences are in the highly conserved domain, the viral genes are always mutating, which can lead to false negatives.In the detection kit for the respiratory bacteria, when the bacterial nucleic acid <10 2 in the reaction system, it may not be detected. The target sequences are in the highly conserved domain; if the bacterial nucleic acid mutates in the target position, it may lead to false negatives. There were 232 patients enrolled in our study, and 123 (53.0%) were male and 109 (47.0%) were female.  To determine whether the etiological agent for CAP varied with age, we compared the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in different age groups. We divided the patients into two groups: patients <65 and \\u226565 years old. In the group of patients <65 years old, the rates of viruses, atypical pathogens and bacteria were 23.6% (45/191), 23.0% (44/191) and 20.4%(39/191), respectively. In the group of patients \\u226565 years old, the rates of viruses, atypical pathogens and bacteria were 41.5% (17/41), 2.4% (1/41) and 14.6% (6/41), respectively. In the group of patients \\u226565 years old, viral infection was the majority, while in the group of patients <65 years old, viruses, atypical pathogens and bacteria were all the main pathogens in CAP. In the nucleic acid test for 20 pathogens, the rate of MP was higher in the patients \\u226565 years old, and the rate of hMPV in the patients \\u226565 was higher (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the other 18 pathogens (Table 1, Figure 1 ). There were a total of 41 polymicrobial infections of the pathogens. The mixed viral infection (viral + bacterial or viral + atypical pathogens) comprised vast majority (61.0%, 25/41). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria cooccurring with virus, followed by Haemophilus influenza and Mycoplasma. In the mixed infection of Mycoplasma and bacterial pathogens (26.8%, 11/41), Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common bacteria co-occurring with Mycoplasma, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In the analysis of multiple bacterial pathogen infections (12.2%, 5/41), Streptococcus pneumoniae plus Haemophilus influenzae was the most prevalent combination. There were only two samples with double viral pathogen infections. (Figure 2 ). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most frequently detected infection in CAP and throughout the year. Infection with this pathogen was highest during August, September, October and November, which are late summer and autumn in China. Influenza virus was highest in January and December, which are winter months. PIVs were detected almost from April to October. In August, we detected most types of viruses, including IFA, hMPV, PIVs, HRVs and EVs. We did not find Legionella in our study of CAP (Figures 3-5 ). 1. The influence of specimen type on positive specimens for different pathogens There were sputum and throat swab specimens in our study, and we analyzed the influence of specimen type on the positive specimens for the different pathogens. The positive detection rate was higher in the sputum specimens, and there was a difference of statistics in RhV and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (P<0.05). The positive detection rate in the sputum and throat swabs were 5.5% vs 0 for RhV and 36.7% vs 3.2% for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively ( Table 2 ). We detected 20 common respiratory pathogens, including 9 viruses, 3 atypical pathogens and 8 bacteria, by RT ADV, hMPV and RSV. [4] [5] [6] [7] In our study, the detection rate of viral infection was 26.7%, and IFVs, PIVs, and RhV were the main viruses. This result was consistent with previous research findings in Chinese adults. In another CAP study of the Japanese population, the most frequently identified pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.6%), Haemophilus influenza (18.5%), and Chlamydia pneumoniae (6.5%), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 5.2%. The frequency of atypical pathogens reached 16.5%, and the virus frequency reached 16.4%. 5, 8 The composition of respiratory pathogens differs from our country. Of those patients who tested positive for viruses, 25 (10.8%, 25/232) had polymicrobial infections, 6 had viruses plus atypical pathogens, and 19 had viruses plus bacteria. In some Chinese studies, the rate of mixed viral and bacterial or atypical pathogens was 5.8-65.7%. 4 Our study demonstrated that nearly half of the patients with viral infection had polymicrobial infections, and the polymicrobial infection demand our attention in clinical work. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection had the highest frequency of detection in CAP and throughout the year (18.9%) in the outpatient study. In a multicenter study of CAP in a Chinese population, Mycoplasmal pneumonia accounted for 20.7%, and it was the most common pathogen, exceeding Streptococcus pneumoniae. 9 In recent studies, Mycoplasma pneumoniae seems to comprise a larger proportion of respiratory pathogens. In our clinical work, we should consider Mycoplasma pneumoniae and make the selection of outpatient antibiotics more targeted. There were some limitations in our study. First, the detection method of bacteria was a limitation because of the absence of urinary testing, serological testing and blood culture, which can detect many additional cases of bacterial pneumonia. Second, it was an outpatient cohort study, and we could only collect sputum and throat swab specimens. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, which may raise the detection rate of respiratory pathogens, could not be collected. We can improve the design method for better detection of respiratory pathogens in the future. In conclusion, our study suggests that viruses were commonly detected in outpatients with CAP, and IFVs were the most common virus, especially during the flu season. Patients with viral infection were prone to viral-bacterial coinfection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was the leading pathogen in the outpatients with CAP. Virals infection occurs in a large proportion of the outpatients with CAP, and it should receive greater attention in clinical work. General ethics approval has been conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Beijing and the respiratory  \", \"of the global SARS outbreak. The difficulty of diagnosing SARS resulted from the nonspecific clinical and radiographic presentation of SARS, which is similar to that of other causes of CAP [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Given the nonspecific presentation of SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other groups proposed case definitions that combined clinical features (e.g., fever or respiratory symptoms) with epidemiological features (e.g., direct contact with another patient with SARS or travel to a SARS-affected area) to improve diagnostic accuracy [11, 12] . Unfortunately, these epidemiological factors are also nonspecific and had poor positive predictive values during the global outbreak, particularly in areas where the incidence of SARS was low [13] [14] [15] . Patients with SARS frequently have hematological and biochemical abnormalities that are revealed by routine laboratory testing, including lymphopenia (in 54%-98%), thrombocytopenia (37%-55%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (35%-87%), elevated creatine kinase levels (14%-36%), hypocalcemia (60%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (29%) [3, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Several case series and reviews of SARS diagnosis, as well as a comparative study, suggest that routine hematological and biochemical abnormalities (particularly lymphopenia) can aid in SARS diagnosis [7, 8, 16, 21, [24] [25] [26] , and current WHO recommendations also suggest measuring hematological and biochemical indices as part of the diagnostic workup for SARS [27] . Despite these recommendations, no study has systematically examined the ability of these tests to accurately discriminate between cases of SARS and cases of CAP due to other causes. This study was intended to assess the ability of routine hematological and biochemical tests to distinguish between SARS-CoV infection and other etiologies of CAP. Patients were included in this database if they presented to an emergency department at a participating hospital in Edmonton with \\u04432 symptoms and signs of CAP and had evidence of pneumonia revealed by their initial chest radiograph, as interpreted by the emergency department physician or internal medicine consultant. The symptoms and signs of CAP used to determine inclusion in this database included cough (productive or nonproductive), pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, fever (temperature, \\u044338.0\\u040aC), or crackles on auscultation. In addition, patients had to be 117 years of age. Pregnant or nursing patients, patients with cystic fibrosis, and patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs that reduced their leukocyte counts to ! cells/L were excluded. Pa- 9 1.0 \\u03eb 10 tients with other causes of leukopenia were not excluded. In addition, patients admitted directly to the intensive care unit from the emergency department were excluded. Data for all patients were entered into the database from 1 November 2000 through 31 October 2002 as part of a study of pneumonia management pathways. Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the research ethics boards at all participating hospitals and the University of Alberta. Patients from either database were included in this study if they presented to an emergency department with respiratory symptoms and had abnormal chest radiograph findings. Patients in the SARS database who met the exclusion criteria for the CAP database were excluded, with 1 exception, from the analysis. Patients from the SARS database who were admitted directly to an intensive care unit were not excluded from the analysis, because the decision to admit patients with SARS to an intensive care unit was based on different criteria from those usually used for CAP, such as the need for negative-pressure isolation rooms and the need to intubate patients with SARS early in the course of disease and under controlled conditions to minimize the risk of transmission. Because serological tests for SARS-CoV were not performed for all patients in the SARS database, it was decided, a priori, to conduct the analysis twice, once using both the seropositive patients and those patients for whom definitive convalescentphase serological testing was never performed and once using only seropositive patients. If the results of both analyses were similar, the first analysis was to be considered the primary analysis. Measurement of laboratory variables. Routine laboratory tests were ordered at the discretion of the treating physicians and were conducted using standard methods at local laboratories serving hospitals in Toronto and Edmonton. Because reference ranges varied between laboratories, results were standardized by dividing individual results by the upper range of normal for the laboratory at which the test was performed. Following analysis, results were converted back into standard units on the basis of the reference range used for all of the patients in the CAP database. Serological testing. Serological status was determined by a combination of ELISA and immunofluorescent antibody methods for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV [28] . Serological status was considered negative if convalescent serum samples obtained \\u044328 days after onset of symptoms had negative serological test results, and serological status was consid- ered positive if \\u04431 method detected IgM or IgG antibodies at predefined dilutions. Statistical analysis. A separate analysis was performed for each laboratory variable. For absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), all patients from the SARS database that had a baseline ALC recorded were included. The largest possible sample of patients from the CAP database who had also had their baseline ALC recorded was then selected, such that the age distribution by decade matched that of the sample from the SARS database. Age-matching was performed to ensure that the presence of differences in laboratory values was because of differences in pathological processes and not simply because of the expected age difference between the 2 cohorts. This process was then repeated de novo for the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, creatine kinase (CK) level, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and serum calcium level. Medians and interquartile ranges were calculated as summaries of continuous variables. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the distributions of each laboratory variable between the SARS database and CAP database patients [29] . Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated as a measure of discriminative ability [30, 31] . Higher AUC values were considered to demonstrate better discriminatory abilities as follows: excellent discrimination, AUC of \\u04430.90; good discrimination, ; fair discrim-0.80 \\u0440 AUC ! 0.90 ination, ; and poor discrimination, AUC of 0.70 \\u0440 AUC ! 0.80 !0.70. The values for each laboratory variable were divided into quintiles on the basis of data for the patients with SARS, such that \\u223c20% of patients with SARS would fall within each of the 5 ranges. Likelihood ratios for the diagnosis of SARS were then determined for values falling within each range. After examining each laboratory test in isolation, all paired combinations of laboratory tests were then compared to determine whether any pair of laboratory variables would have significantly greater discriminatory ability than that of any of the individual variables. Of the 144 patients in the SARS database, 52 were excluded from the analysis because of normal chest radiograph findings at presentation (25 patients), lack of respiratory symptoms at presentation (16) , or both (11) . Of the other 92 patients, the results of serological testing for SARS-CoV were available for 67 and were positive for 65 (97%). Given the high proportion of patients who were seropositive and because no significant differences were seen between the primary analysis (patients with positive serological status or patients who did not have testing of convalescent-phase serum samples performed) and secondary analysis (seropositive patients only), only the results of the primary analysis are presented. Of the 8044 patients in the CAP database, 255 were excluded because of missing age (212 patients) or age !17 years (43 patients). The number of patients that had each laboratory variable measured and the number of patients available after age-matching for each laboratory variable are shown in table 1. Because each laboratory value was assessed individually, numbers vary from test to test. (table  2) . There was no statistically significant difference in the median ALC between patients with SARS and patients with CAP (1.1 \\u03eb 10 9 cells/L vs. 1.2 \\u03eb 10 9 cells/L; ) (table 2) . P p .25 Despite statistically significant differences in median values When ROC curves and AUC were calculated for all paired combinations of laboratory tests, only trivial improvements in AUC were noted, with the maximum AUC being 0.84 (for the paired combination of ANC and ALT levels; data not shown). The likelihood ratios for the diagnosis of SARS for ANC ranged from 7.0 for the lowest quintile (ANC, ! cells/L) to 9 2.25 \\u03eb 10 0.28 for the highest quintile range (ANC, 1 cells/L). 9 6.00 \\u03eb 10 For all other laboratory variables examined, the maximum likelihood ratio for the diagnosis of SARS was 3.3 (LDH level, 334-486 U/L), and the minimum likelihood ratio was 0.41 (ALT level, !22 U/L; data not shown). Furthermore, no specific cutoff value for the ANC could be identified that provided a reasonable sensitivity or specificity. To obtain a sensitivity of 90%, an ANC cutoff value of cells/L provided a specificity of 9 7.6 \\u03eb 10 only 55%; conversely, to obtain a specificity of 90%, an ANC cutoff value of cells/L provided a sensitivity of only 9 3.6 \\u03eb 10 46%. Hematological and biochemical abnormalities occur frequently in patients with SARS. This study also demonstrates that several of these abnormalities occur more frequently in patients with SARS than in patients with CAP. However, to be useful diagnostically, the overlap in the distribution of the results for a given test for patients with SARS and those with CAP must be small. Thus, although statistically significant differences in median values were found for all laboratory variables examined except the ALC, the discriminative ability of these tests was limited by the overlap in their distributions, as seen in the box plots and ROC curves ( figure 1-3) and quantitatively demonstrated by the low AUC seen for all variables tested except the ANC. The identification of the ANC as the most discriminatory test assessed, on the basis of an AUC of 0.80, was an unexpected finding and has not, to the best of our knowledge, been previously reported. The discriminatory ability of the ANC is likely caused by elevated ANCs seen in cases of bacterial CAP rather than by any abnormality of the ANC in patients with SARS. The value of the ANC in clinical practice will be limited for several reasons. First, no cutoff ANC was identified that was both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of SARS. Second, in clinical practice, it will be necessary to distinguish not only between SARS and CAP but also between SARS and other causes of fever and respiratory symptoms, including influenza, other viral respiratory tract infections, and congestive heart failure. Because these other conditions, unlike bacterial CAP, do not typically cause elevations in the ANC, it is unlikely that the low normal ANC typically seen in cases of SARS (median ANC, cells/L) will be capable of distinguishing be- 9 3.85 \\u03eb 10 tween SARS and nonbacterial causes of CAP. The present study has several limitations. First, serological confirmation of the diagnosis of SARS was not obtained for all patients. However, serological test results were positive for 97% of patients tested, and the results of the analysis did not differ when patients without serological results were excluded. Second, because the CAP database did not measure laboratory values over time, we were unable to examine trends in laboratory values after hospital admission. Therefore, it remains possible that greater differences between the laboratory values in patients with SARS, compared with patients with CAP, might occur later in the illness. However, laboratory tests performed late in the course of illness would not help in distinguishing cases of SARS from cases of CAP at the time of initial assessment, when decisions regarding hospital admission, isolation, and treatment must be made. Furthermore, the patients with SARS in this cohort presented to the hospital at a median of Figure 1 .

Given the widespread awareness of SARS, in future outbreaks, patients will likely present earlier, further limiting the value of tests that may not be discriminatory until late in the course of the illness. Third, we examined each test individually but were unable to perform a multivariable analysis because an insufficient number of patients in the CAP database had data for all 6 laboratory values. However, because no individual test demonstrated good discriminatory ability, because the results of several of these tests are unlikely to be independent, and because testing of all paired combinations of tests did not significantly improve discriminatory ability, it is unlikely that any aggregate measurement of these tests is likely to be useful in the diagnosis of SARS.

Since the global SARS outbreak was declared over on 12 June 2003, sporadic cases of animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-like viruses have continued in southern China, and 11 cases of SARS have resulted from laboratory transmission in Singapore, Taiwan, and China [32] . Because the confirmation of a diagnosis of SARS now depends on either serological testing for SARS-CoV (the results of which may not be positive for up to 28 days) or PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV (which continue to have limited sensitivity and specificity early in the course of disease), initial assessment of potential SARS cases continues to rely heavily on clinical, radiographic, and epidemiological factors. However, the assessment of patients .

Therefore, physicians and public health authorities continue to struggle with the difficult task of assessing patients for SARS when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses, particularly if the patients are travelers from or residents of southern China. As a result, national and international public health authorities have continued to develop and revise case definitions in an attempt to improve their diagnostic accuracy. Some have advocated for the inclusion of routine hematological or biochemical test data (in particular, the ALC) in the case definition, given the frequency with which lymphopenia has been reported in association with SARS [27] . Our results do not support this approach, because we were unable to demonstrate significant discriminative ability for any of the laboratory tests that have been suggested for use in the diagnosis of SARS. In particular, the ALC is a poor discriminator between SARS and CAP. Although these results are derived from a single retrospective study, we believe that additional studies assessing the discriminative ability of laboratory tests should be performed before the use of such laboratory tests is recommended in either formal or informal algorithms for SARS diagnosis. \", \"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still a leading cause of death among children aged less than 5 years worldwide, with an estimate of 0.921 million deaths in 2015. Indeed, CAP was second only to preterm birth complications, being the leading cause of death in countries with high under-5 mortality rate, yet important in medium high, and medium child mortality countries. 1 Furthermore, CAP imposes a substantial burden on health services and is a major cause of hospital referral and admission. According to the last estimate, in 2010, roughly 265,000 deaths due to CAP took place in hospitals, 99% of them in developing countries. 2 Therefore, it is possible to observe that 81% of deaths happened outside hospitals, 2 particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia countries. 1 In Brazil, during 2017, 1,117,779 hospital admissions occurred among children under 5 years, and the most frequent causes of admission were respiratory disease (351,763; 31.5%), perinatal complications (277,212; 23.5%), and infectious/parasitic illnesses (163,958; 14.7%). 3 Regarding mortality, 2,349 deaths due to respiratory disease were registered in the same age range, in Brazil, in 2017, i.e., 0.7% of the cases hospitalized died (case fatality rate). 3 These figures are in agreement with the findings of mortality and morbidity according to the economic development of the countries, 1 as Brazil is an upper middle income country. 4 That is, although CAP is not a frequent cause of death, it is a major cause of hospital admission in Brazil. Due to its impact on childhood morbidity and mortality, in health care assistance, it is paramount to be updated in diagnosing and treating children with CAP. Thus, this study aimed to provide cutting-edge information for the management of CAP patients under 5 years, based on the latest evidence published in the literature. Up to the 1990's, bacterial infections were the main concern about CAP etiology, particularly pneumococcal infection. Besides being a classical concept in medicine, derived from the available bacteriological assays that were routinely used to investigate CAP etiology, this concept was highlighted by the finding that death due to CAP was mainly secondary to bacterial infection. 5 Based on this finding, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a program with guidelines aiming to identify children at risk of having CAP, who should receive empiric antibiotic treatment promptly. 6 As a matter of fact, this program was quickly deemed to have a substantial effect on child mortality. 7 Between the end of the last century and the beginning of the current one, significant changes occurred in the childhood CAP scenario. Firstly, the progressive implementation of bacterial conjugate vaccines, specifically the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), 8 the most frequent bacterial causative agents of CAP among children under 5 so far. 9 It has been recognized that the widespread use of Hib vaccine and PCV in countries with high child mortality has been associated with reductions in Hib and pneumococcal cases and deaths. 8 Secondly, the successively widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques (PCRs) has been impacting on the estimation of the proportion of respiratory virus infections in childhood CAP. 10 In an American study conducted in 2,219 children (<18years-old) hospitalized due to CAP, between 2010 and 2012, respiratory viruses were detected in 1,627 (73.3%), out of which 1,472 (90.5%) had only viruses detected. 11 In a Swedish study conducted at the pediatric emergency room or inpatient wards between 2011 and 2014, 121 cases with radiographic evidence of CAP and 240 healthy controls were enrolled, out of which 81% and 56%, respectively, had viruses found; the authors reported that influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were detected in 60% of cases and were significantly associated with CAP with odds ratios >10. 12 In an Australian study carried out in 230 children (<18-years-old) hospitalized with CAP and 230 healthy controls, between 2015 and 2017, respiratory viruses, particularly RSV and HMPV, were major contributors for CAP etiology. 13 The authors estimated that RSV, HMPV, influenza, adenovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were responsible for 20.2% (95% CI: 14.6---25.5), 9.8% (5.6%---13.7%), 6.2% (2.5%---9.7%), 4% (1.1%---7.1%), and 7.2% (3.5%---10.8%) of hospitalizations, respectively. 13 In turn, in a multi-center study conducted in eight developing countries (Cambodia, China, Haiti, India, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, and Paraguay), between 2010 and 2014 (the GABRIEL study), 888 cases hospitalized with radiologically confirmed CAP and 870 healthy controls were recruited; at least one microorganism was detected in 93% of the cases and in 74.4% of the controls. Streptococcus pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, HMPV, rhinovirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus 1, 3, and 4, and influenza virus A and B were independently associated with pneumonia and the authors speculate that increasing S. pneumoniae vaccination coverage may substantially reduce the burden of CAP among children in developing countries. 14 In addition to that, another multi-center study conducted in Bangladash, Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia, all developing countries, between 2011 and 2014 (the PERCH study), 1,769 non-HIV cases with positive chest X-ray, hospitalized with severe CAP, aged 1--- 59 In Brazil, two distinct studies thoroughly investigated CAP etiology. In the first one, 184 hospitalized cases with radiologically-confirmed CAP were included, and only viral, only bacterial, and viral-bacterial infections were found in 67 (36%), 34 (18%), and 43 (23%) patients, respectively, being rhinovirus (21%) and S. pneumoniae (21%) the most common pathogens. 16 Parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 (17%), RSV (15%), influenza A and B (9%), human bocavirus (HBoV; 8%), enterovirus (5%), HMPV (4.1%), and adenovirus (3%) infections were diagnosed. 16---18 In the second study, 774 non-hospitalized cases were recruited, out of which 708 (91.5%) had viruses detected, 491 (69.4%) with multiple viruses; rhinovirus (46.1%), adenovirus (38.4%), enterovirus (26.5%), RSV (24.9%), parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4 (20.5%), HMPV (12.9%), influenza A and B (8.5%), and coronavirus OC43, NL63, and 229E (8.3%) were found. 19 In this study, all viruses were significantly more frequent among cases with multiple detections, except for RSV and influenza viruses. 19 Furthermore, acute HBoV infection was serologically confirmed in 38 (5.0%) of the 759 cases with available paired serum samples. 20 Typical bacterial infections were also searched for, by employing quantitation of specific IgG titers: out of 690 patients with paired serum samples available for these assays, the rate of antibody responses was 15.4% for at least one pneumococcal protein antigen, 5.8% for H. influenzae, and 2.3% for M. catarrhalis; the detection rate of significant antibody increase for at least one of these three bacteria was 20.4%. 21 Atypical bacterial infections were also investigated: M. pneumoniae acute infection was diagnosed through the detection of specific IgM antibodies in the convalescent serum sample, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis acute infections were diagnosed through the detection of specific IgM antibodies or by significant IgG or IgA titer change. Overall, M. pneumoniae (86/787; 10.9%), C. pneumoniae (79/733; 10.8%), and C. trachomatis (3/28; 10.7%) acute infections were diagnosed, and 147 (20.1%) out of 731 patients investigated for these three bacteria had acute infection by at least one of these three bacteria (18 patients had concomitantly positive tests for acute M. pneumoniae and acute C. pneumoniae infection). 22 Based on the aforementioned data, it is possible to observe that respiratory viruses have been increasingly implicated in childhood CAP etiology, along with the recognition that viral infections have been more frequent than bacterial infections, even in developing countries. The screening of children with complaints of acute respiratory infection to diagnose pneumonia relies initially on clinical aspects. Since the early 1990's, the WHO has recommended the use of quantitative tachypnea (age-specific elevated respiratory rates) to identify children that would require treatment with antibiotics for possible pneumonia. 6 It is necessary to clarify that the WHO respiratory rate criteria were selected based on field, observational studies in target epidemiologic settings due to their high sensitivity, reasonable specificity, and ease of implementation where access to formal medical evaluation was limited. Additionally, the evidence base for establishing these criteria is prior to the introduction of vaccines against Hib and S. pneumoniae, regarded as the two major causes of CAP mortality. 23 It is also necessary to emphasize that the WHO respiratory rate criteria are not a diagnostic approach; instead, it was recommended to be employed as an easy tool to identify, among children under 5 years with acute respiratory infection complaints, those who had chance to have a compromised lower respiratory tract, who could then be at risk of dying. In a recently published systematic review of the accuracy of symptoms and physical examination findings to identify cases with radiographic pneumonia among children younger than 5 years, 23 prospective cohort studies of children were included (eight from North America), among which the prevalence of radiographic pneumonia in North American studies was 19% and 37% outside of North America. The presence of moderate hypoxemia (oxygen saturation \\u226496%) and increased work of breathing (grunting, flaring, and retractions) were signs most associated with pneumonia, whereas normal oxygenation (oxygen saturation >96%) decreased the likelihood of pneumonia. Curiously, tachypnea (respiratory rate >40 breaths/min) was not strongly associated with pneumonia diagnosis. 24 Indeed, the limitations of respiratory rate-based pneumonia diagnosis also include overdiagnosis, due to the inclusion of cases of asthma and other respiratory ailments that compromise the lower respiratory tract. 25 In a study conducted in three rural hospitals in Rwanda between May 2011 and April 2012, 147 cases were analyzed and 58% had radiologist-diagnosed pneumonia; the accuracy for diagnosing radiologically-confirmed pneumonia was assessed in 31 historical, clinical, and laboratory signs. Oxygen saturation was the best clinical predictor; its area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.675 [95% CI: 0.581---0.769]; p = 0.001) was higher than that of the respiratory rate (0.528 [95% CI: 0.428---0.627]; p = 0.588). 26 In Malawi, between 2012 and 2014, 13,266 children aged 2---59 months with clinically-diagnosed pneumonia were evaluated; those authors demonstrated that oximetry increased the referral rate for severely hypoxemic children without chest indrawing or danger signs. 27 Indeed, when oximetry data were excluded, retrospective application of the guidelines published by WHO in 2014 28 failed to identify a considerable proportion of severely hypoxemic children eligible only via oximetry. 27 Furthermore, it had been shown that pulse oximetry can not only significantly increase the incidence of correctly treated severe cases but also reduce the incidence of incorrect treatment with antibiotics. 29 The gold standard usually considered in the investigation of predictive signs of pneumonia is radiologically-confirmed pneumonia. Radiologic findings consistent with pneumonia include pulmonary infiltrate, either alveolar or interstitial; alveolar infiltrate is characterized as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or the entire lobe, or even the entire lung, which may or may not contain air-bronchogram, and interstitial infiltrate is defined as linear and patchy densities in a lacy pattern. 30 Interestingly, it had been demonstrated that the sensitivity (95% CI) of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia for pneumococcal infection was 93% (80%---98%); conversely, the negative predictive value (95% CI) of normal chest X-ray was 92% (77%---98%). 31 These findings were detected among hospitalized 31 and non-hospitalized children. 32 Thus, the findings of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia are actually predictors of bacterial pneumonia. Moreover, if the frequency of bacterial pneumonia is decreasing due to the wide implementation of the conjugate vaccines (Hib and PCVs), the accuracy of those predictors may change over time and among different settings, depending on vaccines coverage. From a practical standpoint, bacterial pneumonia should be the target as children with typical bacterial infections, alone or complicated by a viral infection, have worse outcomes than those infected with a virus alone. 11 In a prospective cross-sectional study that investigated CAP etiology (11 viruses and eight bacteria) in hospitalized children under 5 years, the frequency of signs and symptoms was assessed in patients with viral or exclusively bacterial infection; 188 patients had a probable etiology established as only viral (51.6%), mixed viral-bacterial (30.9%), and only bacterial infection (17.5%). Asthma was observed in 21.4%. In the multivariable analysis, viral infection (AdjOR [95% CI]: 9.6; 95% CI: 2.7---34.0), asthma (AdjOR [95% CI]: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.9---11.0), and age (AdjOR [95% CI]: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.97) were independently associated with wheezing on physical examination. The positive predictive value of detected wheezing for viral infection was 96.3% (95% CI: 90.4---99.1%). The authors concluded that wheezing detected on physical examination is an independent predictor of viral infection. 33 However, wheezing does not rule out bacterial infection. As in practice it is not only necessary to identify children with CAP, but mainly those with probable bacterial infection, it is possible that the combination of normal chest X-ray, detection of wheezing upon physical examination, and pulse oximetry may be useful for this goal. This is a potential issue for future research. The use of blood inflammatory biomarkers to distinguish bacterial from viral CAP has been investigated. Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have shown some value in the identification of bacterial infections 34,35 but it has not been established yet a relevant clinical cut-off point for their use. 36 For instance, in an Italian randomized clinical trial, children with non-severe CAP were admitted at the hospital specifically to be included in this PCT investigation: 155 received antibiotics if the mean serum PCT upon admission was \\u22650.25 ng/mL and the remaining 155 children received antibiotics based on the clinical evaluation of the attending physician. Antibiotics were prescribed to 133 children (85.8%) from the first group and 155 children (100%) from the second group, (p < 0.05). The length of antibiotics use was lower (5.37 vs. 10.96; p < 0.05) as well as the frequency of adverse events related to antibiotics use (3.9% vs. 10.96%; p < 0.05) in the group that had serum PCT measured. It is necessary to emphasize that none of the patients who did not receive antibiotics worsened or needed antibiotics afterwards. 37 A Brazilian study described that serum PCT upon admission below 0.25 ng/dL had high negative predictive value for pneumococcal infection (93%; 95% CI:90---99%). 38 It is important to highlight that, in both studies, patients had radiologically-confirmed pneumonia and, for that reason, even with a chest's radiograph that confirms CAP diagnostics, it appears to be possible to identify those children who will not benefit from antibiotic use, for example, considering the serum PCT level <0.25 ng/mL. Additionally, IL-6 was independently associated with pneumococcal infection, having a high neg-ative predictive value among children under 5 years of age hospitalized with CAP. 39 To date, there is lack of this information in non-hospitalized children in this age range. Moreover, a combination of biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, C-reactive protein, and interferon -induced protein) was described to be useful in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in hospitalized children; however, less than 200 children were investigated. 40, 41 A common pitfall in this kind of study is how children without bacterial CAP are identified. For example, in a recently published study from Australia, definite bacterial infection was described as clinical empyema and/or bacteria detected in blood or pleural effusion, while presumed viral pneumonia comprised at least one virus detected in the nasopharyngeal swab without criteria for definite bacterial pneumonia. 42 In fact, by using these definitions, the authors grouped cases in two subgroups: the first with invasive bacterial infection and the second without invasive bacterial infection and possible viral infection. The great challenge in grouping CAP cases with bacterial infection is the diagnosis of non-invasive bacterial infection. 43 When the methods employed do not diagnose non-invasive bacterial infection, these patients are mislabeled as cases without bacterial infection. Undoubtedly, the identification and validation of tools to reliably distinguish, among children with CAP, those with viral infection from those with bacterial infection is a priority in the childhood CAP research field. Clinical management requires assessment for defining whether the patient requires hospitalization. By reviewing seven distinct childhood CAP country representative guidelines, it was possible to observe that the criteria recommended for hospital admission differ between developed and developing countries. 44 In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, signs of respiratory distress including tachypnea are indicators for hospitalization, whereas in Brazil, South Africa, and in the WHO guidelines, tachypnea alone is regarded as an indicator for starting antibiotics on an ambulatory basis. 44 In 2012, the WHO made a considerable change in its guideline: for patients with tachypnea and chest indrawing, to whom the formal recommendation was hospitalization, were indicated oral antibiotic outpatient treatment from 2012 onwards. 45 Figures for developed countries prior to the introduction of PCV estimated approximately 2.6 million episodes of CAP, including 1.5 million (58%) children hospitalized for their illness, annually, among children aged <5 years. 46 In contrast, estimates for developing countries were 151 million new episodes annually, 9% of which were associated with hospitalization. 47 It is possible to observe that the proportion of CAP cases associated with hospitalization was 6.4-fold greater in children from developed (58%) when compared with those from developing countries (9%). The difference in proportion of CAP cases that are hospitalized in developing and developed countries likely reflects a combination of physician differences in management, limited access to health care, and differences on healthcare seeking behavior among parents for children, rather than less severe disease among children in developing countries. 44 Furthermore, the health care system structure differs between developing and developed countries. 44 In reality, no published studies from developed countries have systematically compared outcomes of children treated as outpatients with those of hospitalized children according to varying degrees of respiratory distress. 48 Current recommendations from developed countries are based on the assumption that children have reasonable access to healthcare, including evaluation by a doctor. The attending physician's overall assessment of the child's clinical status and the anticipated clinical course are used to determine whether hospitalization is required. 48, 49 Data from four developing countries participants in the GABRIEL study showed that, out of 405 cases aged 2---60 months hospitalized with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia, 13 (3.2%) died; hypoxemia and S. pneumoniae detection by blood PCR were predictors of death and lower chest indrawing along with cyanosis were predictive of hypoxemia; moreover, HMPV and RSV were independently associated with increased risk of hypoxemia. 50 Furthermore, data from 1,802 children between 1 and 59 months old hospitalized with severe or very severe pneumonia and included in the PERCH study, which was conducted in seven low-and middleincome countries between 2011 and 2014, demonstrated that age <1 year, female sex, \\u2265three days of illness prior to presentation to hospital, low weight-for-height, unresponsiveness, deep breathing, hypoxemia, grunting, and absence of cough were predictors of death; these authors also pointed out that the chance of dying increased according to the number of WHO danger signs present: no danger sign (1.5%), one danger sign (10%), and \\u2265two danger signs (33%). 51 Besides that, the number of WHO danger signs at presentation to hospital (c = 0.82) was more accurate than the PERCH-5 stratum score (c = 0.76) or the Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (c = 0.76). 51 Danger signs included central cyanosis or oxygen saturation <90% on pulse oximetry, inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lethargy (or impaired consciousness), and severe respiratory distress. 51 Severe respiratory distress was defined as nasal flaring, grunting or head nodding (use of auxiliary muscles for breathing) in presence of very labored, fast, or gasping breathing, being the child unable to feed because of respiratory distress and tires easily. 52 All in all, inability to drink/feed, vomiting, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, and head nodding have been recognized as reliable and easily detected predictors of death among hospitalized children with CAP, as well as oxygen saturation <90% (hypoxemia). Despite the fact that these findings were based on cases treated in hospital, and therefore it is not possible to infer which cases may have been successfully managed at home, it is possible to recognize that those were evidencebased predictors that can therefore be used in the clinical management of CAP cases across diverse settings, particularly aiding the decision about which patients should be hospitalized for treatment. Another study, conducted in four hospitals in the United States in 2010, recruited 406 children (<18 years old) hospitalized with clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia, aiming to assess whether radiographic findings predict outcomes. Admission radiographs were categorized as single lobar, unilateral, bilateral multilobar, or interstitial pulmonary infiltrate, as well as with absent, small, or moderate/large pleural effusion. The authors reported that findings of moderate/large pleural effusions and bilateral multilobar infiltrates presented the strongest associations with severe disease, and multilobar (either unilateral or bilateral) and interstitial infiltrate were associated with need for intensive care. 53 Thus, the chest X-ray is a valuable tool that contributes to improve the quality of care and may help predict disease severity. 53 There is a general agreement among distinct international guidelines that orally administered amoxicillin is the first line option to treat outpatients, and ampicillin or aqueous penicillin G or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients with CAP in the under-5 years group. 54 Such agreement is based on a general consensus that S. pneumoniae is the most common and dreadful bacterial causative agent in childhood CAP among children under 5 years and therefore it should be the target of antibiotic therapy. 55 For example, S. pneumoniae detection by blood PCR was recently identified as predictor of hypoxemia among children hospitalized with CAP. 50 A systematic review published in 2016 analyzed all randomized clinical trials, published until April 2015, where children with CAP were treated with antibiotics and followed up: 54 studies were included, out of which, 13 evaluated the efficacy of amoxicillin in non-severe nonhospitalized patients and eight evaluated the efficacy of amoxicillin in hospitalized patients. 56 Thus, amoxicillin was the most studied antimicrobial, with the best methodological approach and the most reliable evidence. Two different dose regimens were compared in a clinical trial conducted in Salvador, Brazil: 820 children with non-severe CAP were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin either twice or thrice a day; this was a placebo-controlled, randomized, triple-blinded clinical trial that showed equivalence on the efficacy of both regimens. 57 Thus, the most comfortable and convenient dosage (50 mg/kg/day twice daily) can be used based on science evidence. It is important to recall that the key pharmacodynamics parameter for amoxicillin efficacy is length of time over the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which should be \\u226540%---50% of the dosing interval during treatment of pneumococcal CAP. 58 A pharmacokinetic study compared twice and thrice daily dosing in children receiving 50 mg/kg/day and reported that 91% of the patients had amoxicillin concentrations above 0.5 ug/mL for >50% of the dose interval and 42% had amoxicillin concentrations above 2.0 ug/L for >50% of the dose interval in the twice-daily dose arm. 59 That indicates that the appropriateness of the 50 mg/kg/day dose of amoxicillin needs to be re-evaluated according to the MIC of the pneumococcal strains isolated in the region. For instance, Canadian authors have recently advised against the routine use of higher doses of amoxicillin to treat nonsevere CAP cases in Canada, as only 0.6% of pneumococcal strains presented intermediate resistance (MIC = 4 ug/mL) to amoxicillin. Those authors also argued that the unjustified use of higher doses of amoxicillin leads to increases in costs, side effects, and total antibiotic exposure, and the harmful effects on the patients' microbiome should also be considered. 60 A common practical question is whether macrolides should be given empirically in the first-line option to treat children with CAP; several attempts have been made to address this question. So far, the strongest evidence has been provided by a Brazilian study: 703 children under 5 years with non-severe CAP were given amoxicillin and were prospectively followed-up; amoxicillin was substituted in 3.5% of children diagnosed with acute infection by M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae and in 2.7% of children without this kind of infection (p = 0.6). Three children with acute infection by C. trachomatis did not present therapeutic failure and amoxicillin was the antibiotic used through the entire treatment period. The authors concluded that it was not necessary to treat atypical bacterial infection in every child aged between 2 and 59 months with non-severe CAP; on the contrary, macrolide use could be reserved for those rare cases in which amoxicillin was not effective. 22 A further practical question regards the length of antibiotic therapy. A systematic review published in 2008 evaluated the efficacy of short and long courses of the same antibiotic, in children aged 2---59 months with nonsevere CAP, and identified two clinical trials in which three and five days of amoxicillin use were compared (one in India and another in Pakistan) and one clinical trial where three and five days of co-trimoxazole were compared (in Indonesia and Bangladesh): neither study indicated differences in the efficacy per treatment length. 61 It is of utmost importance to notice that all three studies diagnosed CAP patients according with WHO diagnostics criteria: presence of tachypnea. Evidently, cases of asthma, bronchiolitis, and other lower respiratory tract diseases were included, and the CAP diagnostics was erroneously made in children with other respiratory morbidities. That is why results from studies that diagnosed CAP using WHO criteria should only be generalized for those cases diagnosed in clinical practice with the same criteria, once these results might be different in radiologically-confirmed pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia. 25 In this context, the author highlights an Israeli clinical trial published in 2014: children aged 6---59 months, with radiological finding of alveolar infiltrate on the chest radiograph taken upon admission, temperature \\u226538.5 \\u2022 C, leucocyte total count \\u226515.000 mm 3 , without dangers signs were followed-up daily. The authors first compared three days of treatment with ten days. Due to 33% rate of therapeutic failure in the first arm against none (0%) in the second arm, a preliminary interim analysis switched the duration of treatment in the first arm to five days. At the end, there were 56 and 59 cases treated either with five or ten days of amoxicillin, respectively, without any therapeutic failure. Authors concluded that five days of amoxicillin are enough to treat CAP with alveolar infiltrate, without danger signs or complications. 62 Remarkably, the WHO significantly altered its recommendation in 2012: for children with fast breathing and wheezing, but no chest indrawing, danger signs, nor fever (<38 \\u2022 C), antibiotics should not routinely be recommended, as the cause is most likely viral infection. 45 This was a rupture from the old policy of prescribing antibiotics for any children younger than 5 years old with cough and tachypnea because of the risk of bacterial infection and death, and is due to the recognition that respiratory viruses are major causes of CAP in children, as well as simple clinical signs such as fever and wheeze may preliminarily screen children who are not prone to have bacterial infection. Some notes are advised about antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients for whom ampicillin or aqueous penicillin G or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options. 54 The American guideline states that the third generation cephalosporins could be the first choice only in those places with high prevalence of pneumococcal resistance to penicillin, that is, with MIC \\u22654 ug/mL. 48 It has already been demonstrated that patients infected with pneumococcal strains with MIC up to 4 ug/mL present good response when treated with aqueous penicillin G at dosage of 200.000 UI/kg/day. 63 It has also been shown that the daily dosage of 200.000 UI/kg/day has the same efficacy if given every 4 h or every 6 h. 64 When treatment is managed with a larger interval between doses, it is more comfortable for patients and healthcare professionals, which enhances adherence, besides being cheaper for healthcare institutions. It is also relevant to comment on how hospitalized patients with CAP evolve during antibiotic treatment. Another Brazilian study included 154 hospitalized children older than 2 months of age with radiologically-confirmed CAP, all treated with aqueous penicillin G (200.000 UI/kg/day) and penicillin was substituted in 26 (18%) cases due to deterioration of clinical status. Among the 128 remaining cases that received aqueous penicillin G throughout the treatment period, tachypnea, fever and chest indrawing were still present after 48 h of antibiotic therapy in 51.0%, 26.8%, and 10.3% of the cases, respectively; those symptoms were present at 120 h after treatment onset in 33.3%, 10.3%, and 2.2% of the cases, respectively. 65 Notably, all patients presented a full recovery and were discharged from hospital with oral amoxicillin replacing aqueous penicillin G for home completion of antimicrobial therapy. These numbers show that patients may have a slow recovery, suggesting that there is no need of antibiotic replacement if the patient does not present clinical/radiological deterioration. Therefore, the use of ceftriaxone in cases with very severe disease or the association of oxacillin or macrolide should occur in specific situations, where it is possible to assume the presence of high penicillin resistant pneumococcus, or \\u2424-lactamase producing H. influenzae (ceftriaxone indication), or Staphylococcus aureus (oxacillin indication), or even atypical bacteria (macrolide indication). 54 Patients under 2 months of age should be hospitalized and receive intravenous antibiotics once they have higher chance of dying from CAP, regardless of other factors when compared with children older than 2 months. 66 In this age stratum, group B streptococcus, Gram-negative intestinal bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, and S. pneumoniae are potential causative agents. 67, 68 Then, antibiotic therapy in this age group includes administration of either intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) ampicillin associated with amynoglycosides throughout the whole treatment and from 1-week-old upwards, it is possible to substitute amynoglycosides for third-generation cephalosporins. 69 If age is <1 month, cefotaxime is the first choice drug, considering hyperbilirubinemia and prematurity. Ceftriaxone increases the risk of kernicterus in these patients, once it has high avidity to serum proteins, especially albumin, which bonds to bilirubin. 70 C. trachomatis should be suspected in the presence of conjunctivitis. In this case, the recommended antibiotic choice is erythromycin. 54 A few comments about corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy should be made. A Spanish study was performed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Sixty children, aged from 1 month to 14 years, with CAP and pleural effusion were included. Those authors described faster recovery rate, measured objectively in hours, in the group that received dexamethasone (DXM) 0.15 mg/kg, every 6 h, for 48 h, plus cefotaxime, when compared with the control group. There were no significant differences in adverse events attributable to the study drugs, except for hyperglycemia. Therefore, the authors concluded that DXM appeared to be a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for decreasing the time to recovery in children with parapneumonic pleural effusion. 71 Another study included children with severe CAP: 29 patients received a 5-day methylprednisolone course plus imipenem and 30 patients received imipenem plus placebo. The authors reported that the methylprednisolone group had a faster resolution of symptoms. 72 A recent systematic review identified four randomized controlled trials that included 310 children; corticosteroids reduced early clinical failure rates (RR 0.41 [95% CI: 0.24---0.70]; high-quality evidence) based on two small, clinically heterogeneous trials, and reduced time to clinical cure. 73 To date, the role of corticosteroids in adjunctive chemical therapy of childhood CAP is yet to be established. Further support is needed to recommend the use of corticosteroids in clinical practice across distinct severity subgroups and in association with different antibiotics, especially \\u2424-lactams. 54 CAP is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children aged under-5 years, worldwide. Currently, respiratory viruses are being recognized as major causative agents. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation \\u226496%) and increased work of breathing are the most associated signs with CAP. In regard to severity assessment, danger signs (inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation <90%) have been recognized as predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. The first line option for antibiotic treatment comprises oral amoxicillin for outpatients and ampicillin or aqueous penicillin G or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) for inpatients. Future investigations should prioritize the identification and validation of tools to distinguish among children with CAP those with viral infection from those with bacterial infection.

Devido ao seu impacto na morbimortalidade infantil, \\u00e9 um objetivo primordial, na assist\\u00eancia de sa\\u00fade, estar atualizado no diagn\\u00f3stico e tratamento de crian\\u00e7as com PAC. Assim, nosso objetivo \\u00e9 fornecer informa\\u00e7\\u00f5es de ponta para o manejo de crian\\u00e7as menores de cinco anos com PAC, com base nas evid\\u00eancias mais recentes publicadas na literatura. At\\u00e9 a d\\u00e9cada de 1990, as infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es bacterianas eram a principal preocupa\\u00e7\\u00e3o sobre a etiologia da PAC, particularmente a infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o pneumoc\\u00f3cica. Al\\u00e9m de ser um conceito cl\\u00e1ssico na medicina, derivado dos ensaios bacteriol\\u00f3gicos dispon\\u00edveis que eram rotineiramente usados para investigar a etiologia da PAC, esse conceito se destacou pelo achado de que a morte por PAC era principalmente por infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana. 5 Com base nesse achado, a Organiza\\u00e7\\u00e3o Mundial da Sa\\u00fade (OMS) lan\\u00e7ou um programa com diretrizes para identificar crian\\u00e7as com risco de PAC e que deveriam receber tratamento emp\\u00edrico com antibi\\u00f3ticos prontamente. 6 De fato, esse programa foi rapidamente considerado como tendo um efeito substancial na mortalidade infantil. 7 Entre o fim do s\\u00e9culo passado e o in\\u00edcio do atual, grandes mudan\\u00e7as ocorreram no cen\\u00e1rio da PAC na inf\\u00e2ncia. Em primeiro lugar, a implanta\\u00e7\\u00e3o progressiva de vacinas bacterianas conjugadas, especificamente a vacina contra o Haemophilus influenzae tipo b (Hib) e as vacinas pneumoc\\u00f3cicas conjugadas (PCV), 8 os agentes causadores bacterianos mais frequentes da PAC na faixa et\\u00e1ria de cinco anos at\\u00e9 o momento. 9 Reconhece-se que o uso disseminado da vacina contra o Hib e das PCV em pa\\u00edses com alta mortalidade infantil tem sido associado a redu\\u00e7\\u00f5es nos casos e mortes por Hib e pneumococos. 8 13 Os autores estimaram que os v\\u00edrus VSR, HMPV, influenza, adenov\\u00edrus e Mycoplasma pneumoniae foram respons\\u00e1veis por 20,2% (IC95%: 14,6 a 25,5), 9,8% (5,6% a 13,7%), 6,2% (2,5% a 9,7%), 4% (1,1% a 7,1%) e 7,2% (3,5% a 10,8%) das hospitaliza\\u00e7\\u00f5es, respectivamente. 13 Por outro lado, em um estudo (Gabriel) multic\\u00eantrico feito em oito pa\\u00edses em desenvolvimento ( 3) . O VSR apresentou a maior fra\\u00e7\\u00e3o etiol\\u00f3gica (31,1%, IC95%: 28,4-34,2) de todos os pat\\u00f3genos. 15 No Brasil, dois estudos investigaram exaustivamente a etiologia da PAC. No primeiro, foram inclu\\u00eddos 184 casos hospitalizados com PAC confirmada radiologicamente, foram encontradas infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es apenas por v\\u00edrus, apenas por bact\\u00e9rias ou infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es por v\\u00edrus e bact\\u00e9rias em 67 (36%), 34 (18%) e 43 (23%) pacientes, respectivamente, os pat\\u00f3genos mais comuns foram o rhinovirus (21%) e S. pneumoniae (21%). 16 Foram diagnosticadas infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es por v\\u00edrus para influenza 1, 2 e 3 (17%), VSR (15%), influenza A e B (9%), bocav\\u00edrus humano (HBoV) (8%), enterov\\u00edrus (5%), HMPV (4,1%) e adenov\\u00edrus (3%). 16---18 19 Nesse estudo, todos os v\\u00edrus foram significativamente mais frequentes nos casos com m\\u00faltiplas detec\\u00e7\\u00f5es, com exce\\u00e7\\u00e3o do VSR e v\\u00edrus influenza. 19 Al\\u00e9m disso, a infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o aguda por HBoV foi sorologicamente confirmada em 38 (5,0%) dos 759 casos com amostras de soro pareadas dispon\\u00edveis. 20 Infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es bacterianas t\\u00edpicas tamb\\u00e9m foram pesquisadas, com a quantifica\\u00e7\\u00e3o de t\\u00edtulos espec\\u00edficos de IgG: de 690 pacientes com amostras de soro pareadas dispon\\u00edveis para esses ensaios, a taxa de respostas de anticorpos foi de 15,4% para pelo menos um ant\\u00edgeno da prote\\u00edna pneumoc\\u00f3cica, 5,8% para H. influenzae e 2,3% para M. catarrhalis, a taxa de detec\\u00e7\\u00e3o de anticorpos foi significativamente aumentada para pelo menos uma dessas tr\\u00eas bact\\u00e9rias para 20,4%. 21 Foram tamb\\u00e9m investigadas infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es bacterianas at\\u00edpicas: a infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o aguda por M. pneumoniae foi diagnosticada pela detec\\u00e7\\u00e3o de anticorpos IgM espec\\u00edficos na amostra de soro convalescente, infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es agudas por Chlamydia pneumoniae e Chlamydia trachomatis foram diagnosticadas pela detec\\u00e7\\u00e3o de anticorpos IgM espec\\u00edficos ou mudan\\u00e7as significativas nos t\\u00edtulos de IgG ou IgA; foram diagnosticadas infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es agudas por M. pneumoniae (86/787; 10,9%), C. pneumoniae (79/733; 10,8%) e C. trachomatis (3/28; 10,7%) e 147 (20,1%), 731 pacientes investigados para essas tr\\u00eas bact\\u00e9rias tinham infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o aguda por pelo menos uma dessas tr\\u00eas bact\\u00e9rias (18 pacientes tinham testes concomitantemente positivos para infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o aguda por M. pneumoniae e C. pneumoniae). 22 Com base nos dados supracitados, \\u00e9 poss\\u00edvel observar que os v\\u00edrus respirat\\u00f3rios t\\u00eam sido cada vez mais implicados na etiologia da PAC na inf\\u00e2ncia, juntamente com o reconhecimento de que as infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es virais foram mais frequentes do que as bacterianas, mesmo em pa\\u00edses em desenvolvimento. A triagem de crian\\u00e7as com queixas de infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o respirat\\u00f3ria aguda para diagnosticar pneumonia baseia-se inicialmente em aspectos cl\\u00ednicos. A OMS recomenda, desde o in\\u00edcio dos anos 1990, o uso de taquipneia quantitativa (taxas respirat\\u00f3rias elevadas espec\\u00edficas da idade) para identificar crian\\u00e7as que necessitam de tratamento com antibi\\u00f3ticos para poss\\u00edvel pneumonia. 6 \\u00c9 necess\\u00e1rio esclarecer que os crit\\u00e9rios da taxa respirat\\u00f3ria da OMS foram selecionados com base em estudos observacionais de campo em cen\\u00e1rios epidemiol\\u00f3gicos-alvo, devido \\u00e0 sua alta sensibilidade, especificidade razo\\u00e1vel e facilidade de implanta\\u00e7\\u00e3o, nos quais o acesso \\u00e0 avalia\\u00e7\\u00e3o m\\u00e9dica formal era limitado. Al\\u00e9m disso, a base de evid\\u00eancias para o estabelecimento desses crit\\u00e9rios \\u00e9 da \\u00e9poca anterior \\u00e0 introdu\\u00e7\\u00e3o de vacinas contra Hib e S. pneumoniae, consideradas as duas principais causas de mortalidade na PAC. 23 Tamb\\u00e9m \\u00e9 necess\\u00e1rio enfatizar que os crit\\u00e9rios de frequ\\u00eancia respirat\\u00f3ria da OMS n\\u00e3o s\\u00e3o uma abordagem diagn\\u00f3stica; em vez disso, recomendou-se que fossem empregados como uma ferramenta f\\u00e1cil para identificar, entre crian\\u00e7as menores de cinco anos com queixas de infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o respirat\\u00f3ria aguda, quem tinha a possibilidade de apresentar comprometimento do trato respirat\\u00f3rio inferior e poderia ent\\u00e3o apresentar risco de morte. Em uma revis\\u00e3o sistem\\u00e1tica publicada recentemente sobre a acur\\u00e1cia dos sintomas e achados do exame f\\u00edsico para identificar casos com pneumonia radiogr\\u00e1fica em crian\\u00e7as menores de cinco anos, 23 estudos de coorte prospectivos em crian\\u00e7as foram inclu\\u00eddos (oito da Am\\u00e9rica do Norte), entre os quais a preval\\u00eancia de pneumonia radiogr\\u00e1fica nos estudos norte-americanos foi de 19% e 37% fora da Am\\u00e9rica do Norte. A presen\\u00e7a de hipoxemia moderada (satura\\u00e7\\u00e3o de oxig\\u00eanio \\u2264 96%) e o aumento do esfor\\u00e7o respirat\\u00f3rio (grunhidos, abertura das narinas e retra\\u00e7\\u00f5es) foram os sinais mais associados \\u00e0 pneumonia, enquanto a oxigena\\u00e7\\u00e3o normal (satura\\u00e7\\u00e3o de oxig\\u00eanio > 96%) diminuiu a probabilidade de pneumonia. Curiosamente, a taquipneia (frequ\\u00eancia respirat\\u00f3ria > 40 respira\\u00e7\\u00f5es/min) n\\u00e3o foi fortemente associada ao diagn\\u00f3stico de pneumonia. 24 De fato, as limita\\u00e7\\u00f5es do diagn\\u00f3stico de pneumonia baseado na frequ\\u00eancia respirat\\u00f3ria tamb\\u00e9m incluem o sobre diagn\\u00f3stico devido \\u00e0 inclus\\u00e3o de casos de asma e outras doen\\u00e7as respirat\\u00f3rias que afetam o trato respirat\\u00f3rio inferior. 25 Em um estudo feito em tr\\u00eas hospitais rurais em Ruanda, entre maio de 2011 e abril de 2012, 147 casos foram analisados e 58% tiveram pneumonia diagnosticada por radiologista; 31 sinais hist\\u00f3ricos, cl\\u00ednicos e laboratoriais tiveram a acur\\u00e1cia para o diagn\\u00f3stico de pneumonia confirmada radiologicamente avaliada: a satura\\u00e7\\u00e3o de oxig\\u00eanio foi o melhor preditor cl\\u00ednico, a sua \\u00e1rea sob a curva ROC (0,675 [IC95%: 0,581-0,769]; p = 0,001) estava acima daquela da frequ\\u00eancia respirat\\u00f3ria (0,528 [IC95%: 0,428-0,627]; p = 0,588). 26 No Malawi, entre 2012 e 2014, foram avaliadas 13.266 crian\\u00e7as entre 2-59 meses com pneumonia clinicamente diagnosticada e os autores mostraram que a oximetria aumentou a taxa de refer\\u00eancia para crian\\u00e7as gravemente hipox\\u00eamicas sem retra\\u00e7\\u00e3o tor\\u00e1cica ou sinais de perigo 27 ; de fato, quando os dados da oximetria foram exclu\\u00eddos, a aplica\\u00e7\\u00e3o retrospectiva das diretrizes publicadas pela OMS em 2014 28 n\\u00e3o identificou uma propor\\u00e7\\u00e3o consider\\u00e1vel de crian\\u00e7as gravemente hipox\\u00eamicas eleg\\u00edveis apenas por meio da oximetria. 27 Al\\u00e9m disso, foi demonstrado que a oximetria de pulso n\\u00e3o s\\u00f3 aumenta significativamente a incid\\u00eancia de casos graves tratados corretamente, mas tamb\\u00e9m reduz a incid\\u00eancia de tratamento incorreto com antibi\\u00f3ticos. 29 O padr\\u00e3o-ouro usualmente considerado na investiga\\u00e7\\u00e3o de sinais preditivos de pneumonia \\u00e9 a pneumonia confirmada radiologicamente. Um achado radiol\\u00f3gico consistente com pneumonia inclui infiltrado pulmonar, alveolar ou intersticial; o infiltrado alveolar caracteriza-se como uma opacidade densa que ocupa uma por\\u00e7\\u00e3o ou todo um lobo ou todo o pulm\\u00e3o, pode ou n\\u00e3o conter broncograma a\\u00e9reo, definido como densidades lineares e irregulares com aspecto ''rendado''. 30 Curiosamente, foi demonstrado que a sensibilidade (IC 95%) da pneumonia confirmada radiologicamente para infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o pneumoc\\u00f3cica foi de 93% (80%-98%); por outro lado, o valor preditivo negativo (IC95%) da radiografia tor\\u00e1cica comum foi de 92% (77%-98%). 31 Esses achados foram detectados em crian\\u00e7as hospitalizadas 31 e n\\u00e3o hospitalizadas. 32 Isso significa que os achados de pneumonia confirmada radiologicamente s\\u00e3o, na verdade, preditores de pneumonia bacteriana. Al\\u00e9m disso, se a frequ\\u00eancia de pneumonia bacteriana est\\u00e1 diminuindo devido \\u00e0 ampla implanta\\u00e7\\u00e3o das vacinas conjugadas (Hib e PCV), a precis\\u00e3o desses preditores pode mudar ao longo do tempo e entre um e outro ambiente, depende da cobertura das vacinas. Do ponto de vista pr\\u00e1tico, a pneumonia bacteriana deve ser o alvo, uma vez que crian\\u00e7as com infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es bacterianas t\\u00edpicas, isoladas ou complicadas por uma infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o viral, apresentam desfechos piores do que crian\\u00e7as infectadas por um v\\u00edrus isolado. 11 Em um estudo transversal prospectivo que investigou a etiologia de 11 v\\u00edrus e oito bact\\u00e9rias em pacientes hospitalizados com PAC com menos de cinco anos, a frequ\\u00eancia de sintomas e sinais foi avaliada em pacientes com infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o viral ou exclusivamente bacteriana; 188 pacientes tinham uma prov\\u00e1vel etiologia estabelecida como infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o somente viral (51,6%), viral-bacteriana mista (30,9%) e somente bacteriana (17,5%). A asma foi registrada em 21,4%. Atrav\\u00e9s da an\\u00e1lise multivariada, a infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o viral (ORAj [IC 95%]: 9,6; IC95%: 2,7-34,0), asma (ORaj [IC 95%]: 4,6; IC95%:1,9-11,0) e idade (ORaj [IC95%]: 0,95; IC95%:0,92-0,97) foram independentemente associadas \\u00e0 sibil\\u00e2ncia ao exame f\\u00edsico. O valor preditivo positivo de sibil\\u00e2ncia detectada para infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o viral foi de 96,3% (IC95%: 90,4-99,1%). Os autores conclu\\u00edram que a sibil\\u00e2ncia detectada no exame f\\u00edsico \\u00e9 um preditor independente de infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o viral. 33 Entretanto, a sibil\\u00e2ncia n\\u00e3o exclui a infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana. Do ponto de vista pr\\u00e1tico, n\\u00e3o s\\u00f3 \\u00e9 necess\\u00e1rio identificar crian\\u00e7as com PAC, mas principalmente os pacientes com prov\\u00e1vel infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana, e \\u00e9 poss\\u00edvel que a combina\\u00e7\\u00e3o de radiografia de t\\u00f3rax simples, a detec\\u00e7\\u00e3o de sibil\\u00e2ncia no exame f\\u00edsico e oximetria de pulso podem ser \\u00fateis, em conjunto, para esse objetivo. Essa \\u00e9 uma quest\\u00e3o potencial para pesquisas futuras. O uso de biomarcadores inflamat\\u00f3rios no sangue para distinguir a PAC bacteriana da viral tem sido investigado. A procalcitonina (PCT) e a prote\\u00edna C-reativa (CRP, do ingl\\u00eas C-Reactive Protein) t\\u00eam demonstrado algum valor na identifica\\u00e7\\u00e3o de infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es bacterianas, 34,35 mas ainda n\\u00e3o foi estabelecido um ponto de corte cl\\u00ednico relevante para seu uso. 36 Por exemplo, em um ensaio cl\\u00ednico randomizado italiano, crian\\u00e7as com PAC n\\u00e3o grave foram admitidas no hospital especificamente para serem inclu\\u00eddas nessa investiga\\u00e7\\u00e3o de PCT: 155 receberam antibi\\u00f3ticos se a m\\u00e9dia de PCT s\\u00e9rica \\u00e0 hospitaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o fosse \\u2265 0,25 ng /mL e as demais 155 crian\\u00e7as receberam antibi\\u00f3ticos com base na avalia\\u00e7\\u00e3o cl\\u00ednica do m\\u00e9dico assistente; 133 indiv\\u00edduos (85,8%) do primeiro grupo e 155 crian\\u00e7as (100%) do segundo grupo receberam antibi\\u00f3ticos, respectivamente (p < 0,05). A dura\\u00e7\\u00e3o do uso de antibi\\u00f3ticos foi menor (5,37 vs. 10,96; p < 0,05), bem como a frequ\\u00eancia de eventos adversos relacionados ao uso de antibi\\u00f3ticos (3,9% vs. 10,96%; p < 0,05) no grupo que teve a PCT s\\u00e9rica medida. \\u00c9 necess\\u00e1rio enfatizar que nenhum dos pacientes que n\\u00e3o recebeu antibi\\u00f3ticos apresentou pioria ou precisou de antibi\\u00f3ticos posteriormente. 37 Um estudo brasileiro descreveu que a PCT s\\u00e9rica na hospitaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o abaixo de 0,25 ng/dL apresentou alto valor preditivo negativo para infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o pneumoc\\u00f3cica (93%; IC 95%: 90-99%). 38 \\u00c9 importante ressaltar que, em ambos os estudos, os indiv\\u00edduos inclu\\u00eddos apresentavam pneumonia confirmada radiologicamente e, por essa raz\\u00e3o, mesmo com uma radiografia de t\\u00f3rax que confirmava o diagn\\u00f3stico de PAC, parece ser poss\\u00edvel identificar aquelas crian\\u00e7as que n\\u00e3o se beneficiar\\u00e3o do uso de antibi\\u00f3ticos, por exemplo, considerando o n\\u00edvel de PCT s\\u00e9rica < 0,25 ng/mL. Al\\u00e9m disso, a IL-6 foi independentemente associada \\u00e0 infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o pneumoc\\u00f3cica, teve alto valor preditivo negativo, em crian\\u00e7as menores de cinco anos hospitalizadas com PAC. 39 At\\u00e9 o momento, h\\u00e1 uma escassez dessas informa\\u00e7\\u00f5es em crian\\u00e7as n\\u00e3o hospitalizadas no mesmo estrato et\\u00e1rio. Al\\u00e9m disso, uma combina\\u00e7\\u00e3o de biomarcadores (ligante indutor de apoptose relacionado ao fator de necrose tumoral, prote\\u00edna C-reativa e prote\\u00edna induzida por interferon ) foi descrita como \\u00fatil na distin\\u00e7\\u00e3o entre infec\\u00e7\\u00f5es bacterianas e virais em crian\\u00e7as hospitalizadas; no entanto, menos de 200 crian\\u00e7as foram investigadas em conjunto nos dois estudos. 40, 41 Um imprevisto comum nesse tipo de estudo \\u00e9 como as crian\\u00e7as sem PAC bacteriana s\\u00e3o identificadas. Por exemplo, em um estudo recentemente publicado na Austr\\u00e1lia, a defini\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana definitiva compreendeu empiema cl\\u00ednico e/ou bact\\u00e9rias detectadas no sangue ou derrame pleural e a pneumonia viral presumida incluiu pelo menos um v\\u00edrus detectado no swab nasofar\\u00edngeo sem crit\\u00e9rios para pneumonia bacteriana definitiva. 42 De fato, com essas defini\\u00e7\\u00f5es, os autores agruparam casos em dois subgrupos: o primeiro com infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana invasiva e o segundo sem infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana invasiva e poss\\u00edvel infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o viral. O grande desafio no agrupamento de casos de PAC com infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana \\u00e9 o diagn\\u00f3stico de infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana n\\u00e3o invasiva. 43 Quando os m\\u00e9todos empregados n\\u00e3o diagnosticam infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana n\\u00e3o invasiva, esses pacientes s\\u00e3o erroneamente identificados como casos sem infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana. Sem d\\u00favida, a identifica\\u00e7\\u00e3o e valida\\u00e7\\u00e3o de ferramentas para distinguir com seguran\\u00e7a em crian\\u00e7as com PAC aquelas com infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o viral daquelas com infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana \\u00e9 uma prioridade no campo de pesquisa da PAC na inf\\u00e2ncia. O manejo cl\\u00ednico requer uma avalia\\u00e7\\u00e3o para definir se o paciente precisa ou n\\u00e3o ser tratado no hospital. Ao revisar sete diretrizes de pa\\u00edses distintos representativas da PAC na inf\\u00e2ncia, foi poss\\u00edvel observar que os crit\\u00e9rios recomendados para hospitaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o diferem entre pa\\u00edses desenvolvidos e aqueles em desenvolvimento. 44 Nos EUA, Canad\\u00e1, Reino Unido e Jap\\u00e3o, sinais de dificuldade respirat\\u00f3ria, incluindo taquipneia, s\\u00e3o indicadores de hospitaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o, enquanto no Brasil, na \\u00c1frica do Sul e nas diretrizes da OMS a taquipneia \\u00e9 considerada um indicador para iniciar antibi\\u00f3ticos em regime ambulatorial. 44 Em 2012, a OMS fez uma altera\\u00e7\\u00e3o consider\\u00e1vel em sua diretriz: os pacientes com taquipneia e retra\\u00e7\\u00e3o tor\\u00e1cica que costumavam receber a recomenda\\u00e7\\u00e3o formal de hospitaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o, a partir de 2012, passaram a ter indica\\u00e7\\u00e3o de antibioticoterapia oral em regime ambulatorial. 45 Os n\\u00fameros dos pa\\u00edses desenvolvidos anteriores \\u00e0 introdu\\u00e7\\u00e3o da PCV estimavam aproximadamente 2,6 milh\\u00f5es de epis\\u00f3dios de PAC, inclusive 1,5 milh\\u00e3o (58%) de crian\\u00e7as hospitalizadas pela doen\\u00e7a, anualmente, em crian\\u00e7as < 5 anos. 46 Em contraste, as estimativas para os pa\\u00edses em desenvolvimento foram de 151 milh\\u00f5es de novos epis\\u00f3dios anuais, 9% dos quais associados \\u00e0 hospitaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o. 47 \\u00c9 poss\\u00edvel observar que a propor\\u00e7\\u00e3o de casos de PAC associada \\u00e0 hospitaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o foi 6,4 vezes maior em crian\\u00e7as de pa\\u00edses desenvolvidos (58%) em compara\\u00e7\\u00e3o com aquelas de pa\\u00edses em desenvolvimento (9%). A diferen\\u00e7a na propor\\u00e7\\u00e3o de casos de PAC hospitalizados em pa\\u00edses desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento provavelmente reflete uma combina\\u00e7\\u00e3o de diferen\\u00e7as referentes ao manejo m\\u00e9dico, acesso limitado a cuidados de sa\\u00fade e diferen\\u00e7as no comportamento de procura de cuidados de sa\\u00fade pelos pais para as crian\\u00e7as, e n\\u00e3o doen\\u00e7a menos grave em crian\\u00e7as de pa\\u00edses em desenvolvimento. 44 Al\\u00e9m disso, a estrutura do sistema de sa\\u00fade \\u00e9 diferente entre pa\\u00edses desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento. 44 Na realidade, nenhum estudo publicado em pa\\u00edses desenvolvidos comparou sistematicamente os desfechos de crian\\u00e7as tratadas ambulatorialmente em compara\\u00e7\\u00e3o com pacientes hospitalizados de acordo com diferentes graus de desconforto respirat\\u00f3rio. 48 As recomenda\\u00e7\\u00f5es atuais dos pa\\u00edses desenvolvidos baseiam-se no pressuposto de que as crian\\u00e7as t\\u00eam acesso razo\\u00e1vel aos cuidados de sa\\u00fade, inclusive a avalia\\u00e7\\u00e3o por um m\\u00e9dico. A avalia\\u00e7\\u00e3o geral do m\\u00e9dico assistente sobre o estado cl\\u00ednico da crian\\u00e7a e o curso cl\\u00ednico antecipado s\\u00e3o usados para determinar se a hospitaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o \\u00e9 necess\\u00e1ria. 48, 49 Dados de quatro pa\\u00edses em desenvolvimento participantes do estudo Gabriel mostraram que, de 405 casos com idade de dois a 60 meses hospitalizados com pneumonia confirmada radiologicamente, 13 (3,2%) morreram; a hipoxemia e a detec\\u00e7\\u00e3o de S. pneumoniae por PCR no sangue foram preditores de morte, enquanto menor retra\\u00e7\\u00e3o tor\\u00e1cica e cianose foram preditivos de hipoxemia; al\\u00e9m disso, o HMPV e o VSR foram independentemente associados ao aumento do risco de hipoxemia. 50 Al\\u00e9m disso, dados de 1.802 crian\\u00e7as entre um e 59 meses hospitalizadas com pneumonia grave ou muito grave e inclu\\u00eddas no estudo Perch, feito em sete pa\\u00edses de baixa e m\\u00e9dia renda, entre 2011 e 2014, demonstraram que a idade < 1 ano, sexo feminino, \\u2265 tr\\u00eas dias de doen\\u00e7a antes da apresenta\\u00e7\\u00e3o no hospital, baixo peso para altura, falta de resposta, respira\\u00e7\\u00e3o profunda, hipoxemia, grunhidos e aus\\u00eancia de tosse foram preditores de morte; eles tamb\\u00e9m indicaram que a chance de morte aumentou de acordo com o n\\u00famero de sinais de perigo da OMS presentes: nenhum sinal de perigo (1,5%), um sinal de perigo (10%) e \\u2265 2 sinais de perigo (33%). 51 Al\\u00e9m disso, o n\\u00famero de sinais de perigo da OMS na apresenta\\u00e7\\u00e3o no hospital (c = 0,82) foi mais preciso do que o escore do estrato Perch-5 (c = 0,76) ou o \\u00cdndice de Gravidade Respirat\\u00f3ria em Crian\\u00e7as (c = 0,76). 51 Os sinais de perigo inclu\\u00edam cianose central ou satura\\u00e7\\u00e3o de oxig\\u00eanio < 90% na oximetria de pulso, incapacidade de beber/alimentar-se, vomitar todo o alimento, convuls\\u00f5es, letargia (ou consci\\u00eancia prejudicada) e desconforto respirat\\u00f3rio grave. 51 O desconforto respirat\\u00f3rio grave foi definido como abertura das narinas, grunhido ou aceno de cabe\\u00e7a (uso de m\\u00fasculos auxiliares para respirar) na presen\\u00e7a de respira\\u00e7\\u00e3o muito dif\\u00edcil, r\\u00e1pida ou ofegante, a crian\\u00e7a \\u00e9 incapaz de se alimentar por causa do desconforto respirat\\u00f3rio e pelo fato de se cansar facilmente. 52 Em suma, a incapacidade de beber/alimentar-se, vomitar todo o alimento, convuls\\u00f5es, menor retra\\u00e7\\u00e3o tor\\u00e1cica, cianose central, letargia, abertura das narinas, grunhidos, acenos de cabe\\u00e7a foram reconhecidos como preditores de morte confi\\u00e1veis e facilmente detect\\u00e1veis em crian\\u00e7as hospitalizadas com PAC, bem como a satura\\u00e7\\u00e3o de oxig\\u00eanio < 90% (hipoxemia). Apesar de esses achados terem sido baseados em casos tratados no hospital e, portanto, n\\u00e3o ser poss\\u00edvel inferir quais casos poderiam ter sido tratados com sucesso em casa, \\u00e9 poss\\u00edvel reconhecer que esses eram preditores baseados em evid\\u00eancias e, portanto, podem ser usados no manejo cl\\u00ednico de casos de PAC em diversos contextos, particularmente auxiliam na decis\\u00e3o sobre quais pacientes devem ser hospitalizados para tratamento. Outro estudo feito em quatro hospitais nos EUA, em 2010, recrutou 406 crian\\u00e7as (< 18 anos) hospitalizadas com evid\\u00eancia cl\\u00ednica e radiogr\\u00e1fica de pneumonia, com o objetivo de avaliar se os achados radiogr\\u00e1ficos predizem os desfechos; as radiografias \\u00e0 hospitaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o foram categorizadas como infiltrado pulmonar de lobo \\u00fanico, multilobar unilateral ou bilateral ou infiltrado pulmonar intersticial, bem como com derrame pleural ausente, pequeno ou moderado/grande. Os autores relataram que os achados de derrames pleurais moderados/grandes e infiltrados multilobar bilaterais mostraram as mais fortes associa\\u00e7\\u00f5es com doen\\u00e7a grave e infiltrados multilobar unilateral ou bilateral e intersticial foram associados \\u00e0 necessidade de cuidados intensivos. 53 Assim, a radiografia de t\\u00f3rax representa uma ferramenta valiosa que contribui para melhorar a qualidade do cuidado e pode ajudar a prever a gravidade da doen\\u00e7a. 53 Existe uma concord\\u00e2ncia geral entre diretrizes internacionais distintas de que a amoxicilina administrada por via oral \\u00e9 a op\\u00e7\\u00e3o de primeira linha para tratar pacientes ambulatoriais e a ampicilina ou penicilina G aquosa ou amoxicilina (administrada inicialmente por via intravenosa) s\\u00e3o as op\\u00e7\\u00f5es de primeira linha para tratar pacientes hospitalizados com PAC no grupo com menos de cinco anos. 54 Tal concord\\u00e2ncia \\u00e9 baseado em um consenso geral de que S. pneumoniae \\u00e9 o agente causador bacteriano mais comum e tem\\u00edvel na PAC infantil entre menores de cinco anos e, portanto, deve ser o alvo da antibioticoterapia. 55 Por exemplo, a detec\\u00e7\\u00e3o de S. pneumoniae por PCR no sangue foi recentemente identificada como preditor de hipoxemia em crian\\u00e7as hospitalizadas com PAC. 50 Uma revis\\u00e3o sistem\\u00e1tica publicada em 2016 analisou todos os ensaios cl\\u00ednicos randomizados, publicados at\\u00e9 abril de 2015, nos quais as crian\\u00e7as com PAC foram tratadas com antibi\\u00f3ticos e acompanhadas: 54 estudos foram inclu\\u00eddos, dos quais 13 avaliaram a efic\\u00e1cia da amoxicilina em pacientes n\\u00e3o hospitalizados n\\u00e3o graves e 8 avaliaram a efic\\u00e1cia da amoxicilina em pacientes hospitalizados. 56 Assim, a amoxicilina foi o antimicrobiano mais estudado, com a melhor abordagem metodol\\u00f3gica e a evid\\u00eancia mais confi\\u00e1vel. Dois regimes de doses diferentes foram comparados em um ensaio cl\\u00ednico conduzido em Salvador, Brasil: 820 crian\\u00e7as com PAC n\\u00e3o grave foram aleatoriamente designadas para receber 50 mg/kg/dia de amoxicilina duas ou tr\\u00eas vezes ao dia; esse foi um ensaio cl\\u00ednico randomizado, triplo--cego e controlado por placebo que mostrou equival\\u00eancia na efic\\u00e1cia de ambos os regimes de tratamento. 57 Dessa forma, a dosagem mais confort\\u00e1vel e conveniente (50 mg/kg/dia duas vezes ao dia) pode ser usada com base em evid\\u00eancias cient\\u00edficas. \\u00c9 importante lembrar que o principal par\\u00e2metro farmacodin\\u00e2mico para a efic\\u00e1cia da amoxicilina \\u00e9 o tempo de dura\\u00e7\\u00e3o acima da concentra\\u00e7\\u00e3o inibit\\u00f3ria m\\u00ednima (CIM), que deve ser \\u2265 40%-50% do intervalo entre as doses durante o tratamento da PAC pneumoc\\u00f3cica. 58 Um estudo farmacocin\\u00e9tico comparou doses de duas e tr\\u00eas vezes ao dia em crian\\u00e7as que receberam 50 mg/kg/dia e relatou que 91% dos pacientes apresentavam concentra\\u00e7\\u00f5es de amoxicilina acima de 0,5 g/mL por > 50% do intervalo de dose e 42% tinham concentra\\u00e7\\u00f5es de amoxicilina acima de 2,0 g/L por >50% do intervalo de dose no bra\\u00e7o da dose administrada duas vezes ao dia. 59 Isso significa que a adequa\\u00e7\\u00e3o de 50 mg/kg/dia de amoxicilina precisa ser reavaliada de acordo com a CIM das cepas de pneumococo isoladas na regi\\u00e3o. Por exemplo, autores canadenses recentemente desaconselharam o uso rotineiro de altas doses de amoxicilina para tratar casos de PAC n\\u00e3o grave no Canad\\u00e1, j\\u00e1 que apenas 0,6% das cepas de pneumococo apresentaram resist\\u00eancia intermedi\\u00e1ria (CIM = 4 g/mL) \\u00e0 amoxicilina. Esses autores tamb\\u00e9m argumentaram que o uso n\\u00e3o justificado de altas doses de amoxicilina leva ao aumento de custos, efeitos colaterais e exposi\\u00e7\\u00e3o total a antibi\\u00f3ticos, efeitos prejudiciais no microbioma dos pacientes tamb\\u00e9m devem ser considerados. 60 Uma quest\\u00e3o pr\\u00e1tica comum \\u00e9 se macrol\\u00eddeos devem ser administrados empiricamente como op\\u00e7\\u00e3o de primeira linha para tratar crian\\u00e7as com PAC e v\\u00e1rias tentativas foram feitas para abordar essa quest\\u00e3o. At\\u00e9 o momento, a evid\\u00eancia mais forte foi fornecida por um estudo brasileiro: 703 crian\\u00e7as inclu\\u00eddas com menos de cinco anos tinham PAC n\\u00e3o grave, receberam amoxicilina e foram acompanhadas prospectivamente; a amoxicilina foi substitu\\u00edda em 3,5% das crian\\u00e7as diagnosticadas com infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o aguda por M. pneumoniae ou C. pneumoniae e em 2,7% das crian\\u00e7as sem esse tipo de infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o (p = 0,6). Tr\\u00eas crian\\u00e7as com infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o aguda por C. trachomatis n\\u00e3o apresentaram falha terap\\u00eautica e a amoxicilina foi o antibi\\u00f3tico usado durante todo o per\\u00edodo de tratamento. Os autores conclu\\u00edram que n\\u00e3o era necess\\u00e1rio tratar a infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana at\\u00edpica em todas as crian\\u00e7as entre 2-59 meses com PAC n\\u00e3o grave; ao contr\\u00e1rio, o uso de macrol\\u00eddeos poderia ser reservado para aqueles casos raros em que a amoxicilina n\\u00e3o era eficaz. 22 Uma outra quest\\u00e3o pr\\u00e1tica \\u00e9 sobre a dura\\u00e7\\u00e3o da terapia antibi\\u00f3tica. Uma revis\\u00e3o sistem\\u00e1tica publicada em 2008 avaliou a efic\\u00e1cia de tratamentos curtos e longos do mesmo antibi\\u00f3tico, em crian\\u00e7as de 2-59 meses, com PAC n\\u00e3o grave, e identificou dois ensaios cl\\u00ednicos nos quais tr\\u00eas e cinco dias de tratamento com amoxicilina foram comparados (um na \\u00cdndia e outro no Paquist\\u00e3o) e um ensaio cl\\u00ednico em que foram comparados tr\\u00eas e cinco dias de Cotrimoxazol (na Indon\\u00e9sia e Bangladesh): nenhum estudo mostrou diferen\\u00e7a na efic\\u00e1cia da dura\\u00e7\\u00e3o do tratamento. 61 \\u00c9 de suma import\\u00e2ncia notar que todos os tr\\u00eas estudos diagnosticaram pacientes com PAC de acordo com os crit\\u00e9rios diagn\\u00f3sticos da OMS: presen\\u00e7a de taquipneia. Evidentemente, foram inclu\\u00eddos casos de asma, bronquiolite e outras doen\\u00e7as do trato respirat\\u00f3rio inferior, o diagn\\u00f3stico de PAC foi erroneamente feito em crian\\u00e7as com outras morbidades respirat\\u00f3rias. \\u00c9 por isso que os resultados de estudos que diagnosticaram PAC com crit\\u00e9rios da OMS devem ser generalizados apenas para os casos diagnosticados na pr\\u00e1tica cl\\u00ednica com os mesmos crit\\u00e9rios, uma vez que esses resultados podem ser diferentes na pneumonia confirmada radiologicamente ou na pneumonia bacteriana. 25 Nesse contexto, enfatizamos um ensaio cl\\u00ednico publicado em 2014 e feito em Israel: crian\\u00e7as de seis a 59 meses, com achado radiol\\u00f3gico de infiltrado alveolar na radiografia de t\\u00f3rax na hospitaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o, temperatura \\u2265 38,5 \\u2022 C, contagem total de leuc\\u00f3citos \\u2265 15.000/mm 3 , sem sinais de perigo foram acompanhadas diariamente, tr\\u00eas dias de tratamento foram inicialmente comparados com dez dias. Devido \\u00e0 taxa de falha terap\\u00eautica de 33% no primeiro bra\\u00e7o contra nenhum (0%) no segundo bra\\u00e7o do estudo, uma an\\u00e1lise preliminar interina mudou a dura\\u00e7\\u00e3o do tratamento no primeiro bra\\u00e7o para cinco dias. No fim, foram 56 e 59 casos tratados com cinco ou dez dias de amoxicilina, respectivamente, sem qualquer falha terap\\u00eautica. Os autores conclu\\u00edram que cinco dias de amoxicilina s\\u00e3o suficientes para tratar a PAC com infiltrado alveolar, sem sinais de perigo ou complica\\u00e7\\u00f5es. 62 Notavelmente, a OMS fez uma grande mudan\\u00e7a em sua recomenda\\u00e7\\u00e3o em 2012: para crian\\u00e7as com respira\\u00e7\\u00e3o r\\u00e1pida e sibil\\u00e2ncia, mas sem retra\\u00e7\\u00e3o tor\\u00e1cica, sinal de perigo ou febre (< 38 \\u2022 C), os antibi\\u00f3ticos n\\u00e3o devem ser rotineiramente recomendados, pois a causa \\u00e9 mais prov\\u00e1vel \\u00e9 uma infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o viral. 45 Esse foi um avan\\u00e7o sobre a velha pol\\u00edtica de prescrever antibi\\u00f3ticos para qualquer crian\\u00e7a menor de cinco anos com tosse e taquipneia por causa do risco de infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana e morte e \\u00e9 devido ao reconhecimento de que os v\\u00edrus respirat\\u00f3rios s\\u00e3o as principais causas de PAC em crian\\u00e7as, bem como sinais cl\\u00ednicos simples, como febre e sibil\\u00e2ncia, podem identificar preliminarmente crian\\u00e7as que n\\u00e3o s\\u00e3o propensas a ter infec\\u00e7\\u00e3o bacteriana. Alguns registros aconselham sobre antibioticoterapia em pacientes hospitalizados, nos quais ampicilina ou penicilina aquosa G ou amoxicilina (administrada inicialmente por via intravenosa) s\\u00e3o as op\\u00e7\\u00f5es de primeira linha. 54 A diretriz americana diz que as cefalosporinas de terceira gera\\u00e7\\u00e3o poderiam ser a primeira escolha apenas naqueles locais com alta preval\\u00eancia de resist\\u00eancia pneumoc\\u00f3cica \\u00e0 penicilina, ou seja, com concentra\\u00e7\\u00e3o inibit\\u00f3ria m\\u00ednima (CIM) \\u2265 4 g/mL. 48 J\\u00e1 foi demonstrado que pacientes infectados com cepas de pneumococos com CIM de at\\u00e9 4 ug/mL apresentam boa resposta quando tratados com penicilina G aquosa na dose de 200.000 UI/kg/dia. 63 Tamb\\u00e9m foi demonstrado que a dosagem di\\u00e1ria de 200.000 UI/kg/dia tem a mesma efic\\u00e1cia se dada a cada quatro horas ou a cada seis horas. 64 Quando o tratamento \\u00e9 administrado com maior intervalo entre as doses, \\u00e9 mais confort\\u00e1vel para os pacientes e profissionais de sa\\u00fade, o que aumenta a ades\\u00e3o, al\\u00e9m de ser mais barato para as institui\\u00e7\\u00f5es de sa\\u00fade.

Combined analysis of IP-10 and IFN-\\u03b3 has also been reported as a useful biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring therapeutic efficacy in patients with active tuberculosis [15] [16] [17] , and both remain detectable in the urine of patients with pulmonary diseases in the absence of renal dysfunction 18 . With airway epithelial cells 19 , resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) and blood monocytes-derived macrophages (recruited into tissues under inflammatory conditions 20, 21 ) represent a major line of defense against both pneumococcal (through their high phagocytic capacity [22] [23] [24] ) and influenza infection 25, 26 . So far, no studies have yet focused on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate IP-10 in human blood leukocytes during mixed IAV and SP infection. Several studies indicated that host non-coding small RNAs (including microRNAs) may function as immunomodulators by regulating several pivotal intracellular processes, such as the innate immune response 27 and antiviral activity 28, 29 ; both of these processes are closely related to toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. In this study, we firstly investigated the in vitro intracellular mechanisms that mediate the innate immune response in IAV and/or SP infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Using this approach, we observed that mixed-infection of MDMs induces a synergistic production of IP-10 which can be related to a miRNA-200a/JAK-STAT/SOCS-6 regulatory pathway. Subsequently, in a retrospective analysis of clinical samples collected from children \\u2264 5 years-old hospitalized with pneumonia, we confirmed that serum IP-10 level could be related to both viral and/or bacterial etiologies and disease severity. Characteristics of MDMs infected by IAV and/or SP. Initially, we investigated in vitro the impact of single and mixed IAV and SP infection on MDMs. Firstly, active replication of IAV was assessed by qRT-PCR and quantification of new infectious viral particles in the cell supernatants ( Fig. 1a,b ). IAV titer increased over time after single infection with IAV and correlated with increased production of negative-strand IAV RNA. Maximum viral replication was observed at 18-24 hours post-infection, after which time both RNA replication and the quantity of infectious particles decreased. In this in vitro model, subsequent challenge of IAV-infected MDMs with SP had no significant impact on the production of new infectious viral particles (Fig. 1b) . Together, these results indicate permissive and productive infection of MDMs by IAV. Secondly, we evaluated whether MDMs are permissive for both IAV and SP infection. The presence of pneumococci within IAV-and SP-infected primary MDMs was confirmed at 8 h post-infection (Fig. 1c) , suggesting that MDMs are permissive for viral and bacterial co-infection in the early steps of infection. Importantly, confocal co-detection of mixed IAV and SP was only effective following 8 h post-infection due to the bactericidal impact of SP internalization within human macrophages (after 24 h, data not shown). Thirdly, we evaluated the impact of single and mixed infection with IAV and SP on MDM viability. Mixed infection significantly decreased cell viability (65.2 \\u00b1 4.5% total cell death at 48 hours post-infection; P < 0.0001) compared to single SP and IAV infection (39.6 \\u00b1 1.7% and 17.4 \\u00b1 1.1% total cell death, respectively; Fig. 1d ). Taken together, these results confirmed human MDMs are permissive to mixed viral and bacterial infection. mRNA, microRNA and protein expression profiling reveal an overall induction of the host innate immune response following IAV and/or SP infection of MDMs. To investigate the innate immune response orchestrated by IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs, we firstly evaluated the expression of 84 genes involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses (Table S1) ; the major differentially-expressed genes are summarized in Fig. 2a . Expression profiling indicated an overall induction of genes related to the JAK-STAT, NF-\\u039a \\u03b2 and TLR signaling pathways. Indeed, all interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) screened, including CXCL10 (fold-change [FC] = 240.9), CCL-2 (FC = 34.2) and MX-1 (FC = 151.4) were upregulated following mixed infection compared to uninfected cells, most of which are closely related to STAT-1 (FC = 52.3), IRF-7 (FC = 6.8) and IFNB1 (FC = 5.2) also found upregulated in mixed infected cells. Secondly, we investigated the endogenous microRNA expression profiles of IAV-and SP-infected MDMs. A selection of microRNAs that were found to be differentially-expressed under different infection conditions are shown in Fig. 2b and Table S2 . MiRNA-200a-3p was overexpressed after both single IAV (FC = 6.9), single SP (FC = 3.7) and mixed IAV/SP infection (FC = 7.3), indicating this miRNA may play a role in the innate immune response to viral and bacterial co-infection. Similar miRNA-200a-3p dysregulation profiles were obtained following IAV and/or SP infections of human macrophages-like (THP-1 monocytes-derived macrophages) or primary MDMs (data not shown). Thirdly, the secreted levels of various antiviral, pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines/chemokines were assayed in IAV-and SP-infected-THP-1 and primary MDM cell supernatants. We observed a remarkable correlation between the mRNA and protein expression profiles of single or mixed infected MDMs especially regarding CXCL-10 and IP-10 expression. Indeed, the level of IP-10 was synergistically increased in the supernatant of IAV-infected THP-1 MDMs exposed to SP (mean: 30,589 \\u00b1 16,484 pg ml \\u22121 ) compared to single IAV infection (1,439 \\u00b1 566.5 pg ml \\u22121 ) and single SP infection (4,472 \\u00b1 2,001 pg ml \\u22121 ; P\\u2264 0.05; Fig. 2c ) at 24 hours after infection. In those cells, IP-10 expression reduced over time (48 to 72 hours), coinciding with a significant higher proportion of necrotic and apoptotic cells (Fig. 1d) . The synergistic expression of IP-10 was similarly observed at 24 hours post-infection using primary MDMs (Fig. 2d) . Significantly increased secretion of the other tested cytokines and chemokines was not observed post-infection, even in mixed infected MDMs (Fig. S1 ). Interestingly, a significant production of IP-10 was also observed in supernatants of primary human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) mixed-infected by IAV and SP compared to the single infections (Fig. 2e) . Taken together, the mRNA and protein profiling results suggested that mixed viral and bacterial infection of MDMs induces a synergistic pro-inflammatory response related to the type-1 interferon and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, with IP-10 as signature of IAV/SP co-infection. Among all microRNAs screened, miR-200a-3p was the most Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 overexpressed in IAV/SP co-infection of human MDMs. In the remainder of this study, we decided to investigate the interconnection between miR-200a-3p expression and the innate immune response. Endogenous miRNA-200a-3p expression correlates with CXCL10 (IP-10) induction following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs. Using a specific Taqman probe assay targeting miR-200a-3p, we confirmed a significant upregulation of miR-200a-3p following mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs (Fig. 3a) . In this experiment, a more marked up-regulation of miR-200a-3p was observed following IAV+ SP compared to results obtained previously (Fig. 2b) . This discrepancy has been attributed to the use of two different approaches to quantify miR-200a-3p expression. The use of a target-specific stem-loop reverse transcription primer in Fig. 3a allows a better sensitivity of miR-200a-3p detection compared to the non-specific fluorescent dye used in Fig. 2b . As the general trend was suggestive of a synergistic induction of miR-200a-3p in response to mixed infection (Fig. 3a) , we hypothesized microRNA-200a-3p may play a role in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10), which was also synergistically upregulated in mixed-infected MDMs ( Fig. 2c and d) and primary HAEC ( Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 CXCL10 (Fig. 3d) . These results suggested miR-200a-3p indirectly regulates CXCL10 and led us to hypothesize that miR-200a-3p controls a potential repressor of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. . At 18 h after transfection, the MDMs were singly or mixed infected as described previously. At 8 h post-IAV and/or SP infection, total mRNA was extracted and amplified by PCR using specific primers for the indicated genes. Values represent median \\u00b1 IQR (a, c) or mean \\u00b1 SEM (d, e) of three biological replicates. Statistical analyses were performed using a Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric, one-way ANOVA with Dunn's post-hoc test) for data presented in (a, c). An ordinary two-way ANOVA (with Tukey's post-hoc multiple comparison test) was used for data presented in (d, e). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. MiRNA-200a-3p indirectly regulates IP-10 expression by targeting SOCS6. As shown in Fig. 2a , several JAK-STAT signaling pathway genes were deregulated in mixed IAV-and SP-infected human MDMs; therefore, we hypothesized that miR-200a-3p directly regulates a regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Predictive target analysis indicated that the 3' UTR of suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS6) may be targeted by miR-200a-3p (Fig. 3b) . SOCS proteins constitute a class of negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling pathways that are induced by both cytokines and TLR signaling. MiRNA-200a-3p was not predicted to target any of the other six members of the SOCS gene family. Transfection of human MDMs with MIM-200a downregulated SOCS6 (FC = 0.57) while inhibition of miR-200a-3p (INH-200a) upregulated SOCS6 (FC = 1.55), confirming that miR-200a-3p effectively regulates the expression of SOCS6 (Fig. 3e) . Moreover, SOCS6 was synergistically downregulated in IAV-or IAV/SP-infected MDMs overexpressing miRNA-200a (Fig. 3e) , suggesting that both infection and miR-200a-3p negatively regulate the expression of SOCS6. Finally, western blotting confirmed that expression of SOCS-6 sharply reduced following infection, especially after mixed IAV and SP infection (Fig. 3f) . These results indicate miR-200a-3p is strongly induced in response to mixed viral and bacterial co-infection, which in turn leads to downregulation of the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 at both the mRNA and protein levels and subsequent upregulation of IP-10. analyses demonstrated mixed IAV and SP infection of human MDMs and HAEC induced significant production of IP-10. As blood leukocytes and respiratory tract epithelial cells actively contribute to inflammation during pneumonia, we hypothesized the level of IP-10 in serum of patient with pneumonia may be both indicative of mixed respiratory infection and disease severity. As part of a prospective, hospital-based, multicenter case-control study on the etiology of pneumonia among children under 5-years-old, a total of 74 patients (44 male, 30 female) were included in this pilot evaluation. According to WHO guidelines, retrospective analysis indicated 44 (59.5%) children had clinical signs of non-severe pneumonia and 30 (40.5%) children had signs of severe pneumonia. The main patient characteristics at inclusion are shown in Table 1 . Patients with severe pneumonia had significant more recorded episodes of dyspnea (P < 0.001), cyanosis (P = 0.03), lower chest indrawing (P < 0.001), dullness to percussion (P < 0.001) and lethargy (P < 0.001) during chest examination than patient with non-severe pneumonia. Moreover, pleural effusions were significantly more observed among critically ill patients and the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for the children with severe pneumonia than for those with non-severe pneumonia (P = 0.0015). Two deaths occurred within the group of children retrospectively defined with severe pneumonia. Evaluation of the systemic inflammatory response of the 74 cases is shown in Table 2 . Serum level of CRP, IP-10, PCT, G-CSF, IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1\\u03b2 were significantly more elevated in serum samples from critically ill patients. Patients with severe pneumonia had significantly higher (4.2-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a non-severe pneumonia (P < 0.001) suggesting IP-10 as a promising prognostic marker in pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy measures for predicting pneumonia severity using blood-based biomarkers are summarized in Table S3 . Briefly, in this study, the optimal IP-10 cut-off value for identifying patient with severe pneumonia was 4,240 pg ml \\u22121 , with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82, P < 0.001). Defining as positive a serum IP-10 level above this cut-off resulted in a sensitivity of 63.3%, specificity of 63.6% and a positive likelihood ratio of 1.74. Prognostic values of IP-10 were closed to procalcitonin (PCT; AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58 to 0.82, P < 0.001) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.70; 95% IC, 0.58-0.83, P < 0.001). Multiplex PCR-based screening of respiratory and blood samples reveal a high variety of pathogen associations (Table 3) . Respiratory viruses were detected in the nasal aspirates (NAs) of 63/74 patients (85.1%). Etiological bacteria of pneumonia (S. pneumoniae, n = 19; S. aureus, n = 1; or H. influenzae type B, n = 7) were identified via real-time PCR in the blood samples of 27/74 (36.5%) of the patients. Multiplex PCR assays allowed the identification of respiratory bacteria in the blood of 19 patients with negative blood culture results. Among the 74 cases PCR-positive for respiratory pathogens, a single virus or bacteria were detected in the NAs of 7 (9.4%) and 3 (4.0%) patients, respectively; these 10/74 (13.5%) cases were defined as the single infection group. The mixed infection group included the 62/74 (83.8%) cases in which (1) multiple viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs (38/74; 51.3%) without any bacteria identified in blood samples or (2) one or more viruses and/or bacteria were identified in NAs and associated with a blood bacteremia (24/74; 32.4%). We evaluated whether IP-10 serum level could correlate with the viral and bacterial etiologies of pneumonia. Patients with mixed infection had significant higher (3.6-fold) IP-10 serum level than patient with single detection (P = 0.03; Table 4 ). A stratified analysis reveals that the highest IP-10 serum level was observed among patients with both several respiratory pathogens identified (mixed-detection group) and severe pneumonia (14,427 pg ml \\u22121 , IQR (3,981-82,994). In detail, a remarkable IP-10 serum level (142,531 pg ml \\u22121 ), representing 33-fold higher above cut-off value predicting pneumonia severity was observed in patient with hRV in NA co-detected with S. pneumoniae (serotype 14) in pleural effusion and blood. In concordance with our in-vitro model of co-infection, a significant IP-10 level (90,338 pg ml \\u22121 ) was quantified in blood sample of patient with severe bacteremic pneumococcal (serotype 14) pneumonia with a positive co-detection of Influenza B virus in NA. Taken together, these results suggest that high serum IP-10 levels are significantly associated with mixed viral and bacterial detection and also related to pneumonia pathogenesis. This study provides additional in vitro and clinical data to improve our understanding of the immunopathology of mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia (Fig. 4) . The in vitro model of influenza and pneumococcal superinfection of human MDMs demonstrated that mixed infection synergistically induced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10, strongly suggesting human Scientific RepoRts | 6:38532 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38532 blood leukocytes contribute to the immunopathology of pneumonia. Additionally, transcriptomics and omics analyses provided new data on the inflammatory pathways that are activated during mixed infection and related to synergistic induction of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 in mixed infected cells. Our observations are consistent with a recent study describing IP-10 induction as host-proteome signature of both viral and bacterial infections 30 . Of the differentially-expressed genes observed in mixed infected MDMs, the transcription factors STAT-1 and IRF-7 appear to play crucial roles in the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes including CXCL10 (IP-10). By focusing on the intracellular mechanisms that regulate inflammatory pathways, we demonstrated a novel role for miRNA-200a-3p in the regulation of CXCL10 (IP-10). These observations are consistent with previous reports showing that RNA virus infection upregulates miR-155 in macrophages and dendritic cells and also regulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), suggesting the existence of a miRNA/JAK-STAT/SOCS regulatory pathway during viral infection 29 . Our study suggests co-infection leads to overexpression of miR-200a-3p, which in turn targets and downregulates the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 and consequently increases CXCL10 (IP-10) expression. Interestingly, a complementary in-silico approach reveals that several microRNAs that were found dysregulated in our experiments of IAV and SP co-infection of MDMs or HAEC, might target several genes of SOCS family and play similar role than miR-200a-3p. Indeed, miRNA-142-3p might target SOCS4, 5, 6 mRNA while miRNA-194-5p might target SOCS2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 mRNA. These observations underline that intra-cellular regulation of IP-10 is not limited to the contribution of a sole microRNA. A complex inter-relationship between numerous host microRNAs and inhibitors of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway occur to control host innate inflammatory response against viral and/or bacterial infections. Clinically, the majority of pediatric CAP cases in this study were associated with both positive viral and/or bacterial detection. Respiratory microorganisms were detected in 97% of cases; 51.3% of which were viral-viral, viral-bacterial or bacterial-bacterial co-detected only in nasal aspirates, 32.4% of which co-detected in both nasal aspirates and blood samples. These data are consistent with previous etiological studies of pediatric CAP 3,31-33 . S. pneumoniae was the major bacteria identified in blood (19/74; 25.7%) and mainly co-detected with respiratory viruses in NAs (16/19; 84.2%). We observed a very high diversity of viral and bacterial associations in biological samples from children with pneumonia. In comparison with IAV and SP14 combination evaluated in-vitro, no pneumonia cases were singly influenza and pneumococcus infected, and no similar co-detection with those two pathogens has been clinically observed. Nevertheless, Influenza B (IVB) virus was identified in 5 patients and two of them had a positive SP co-detection in blood (one non-typable strain and one serotype 14 using our molecular typing test). IVB and SP14 combination seems to be the nearest pathogen co-detection to that in-vitro investigated. Clinically, this co-detection was associated with both a very high IP-10 expression and a very severe pneumonia case definition. Interestingly, our translational pilot evaluation reveals IP-10 expression can be induced by several different viral and/or bacterial combinations. As immune response to each pathogen is different, further in-vitro investigations using different pathogens associations are needed to better characterize the mechanisms involved in the immunopathology of pneumonia. In this cohort, highest serum IP-10 levels were identified among patients with both several pathogen detected and severe pneumonia, suggesting a significant role of IP-10 on pneumonia pathogenesis. Indeed, high plasma levels of IP-10 have previously been reported in patients with sepsis 12 , and were associated with high mortality rate, especially among patients with CAP 34 . Additionally, the IP-10-CXCR3 axis has been related to acute immune lung injury and lymphocyte apoptosis during the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 35, 36 . Moreover, an in vivo study that modeled influenza and pneumococcal superinfection in mice indicated that pro-inflammatory chemokines, including IP-10, play a crucial role in influenza-induced susceptibility to lung neutrophilia, severe immunopathology and mortality 37 . In this study, markedly elevated IP-10 (92,809 pg ml \\u22121 ) combined with the highest PCT level (74.4 pg ml \\u22121 ) were quantified in the serum sample of a child who died, in whom S. pneumoniae (serotype 9 V) was identified in the blood (PCR and blood culture) and co-detected with Haemophilus influenzae type B in nasal aspirate. These observations suggest an interrelationship between co-detection, elevated serum IP-10 and the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Several limitations of this pilot translational study need to be acknowledged before concluding mixed infection is related to elevated IP-10 and disease severity. Indeed, although viral shedding (e.g., of HRV and HBoV) is common in asymptomatic children, we were unable to evaluate the levels of immunomodulators in the serum samples of a control group. Moreover, although the samples were collected within the first 24 hours after admission, only a single blood sample was processed for each patient. Therefore, a larger, longitudinal study on the etiology and severity of pneumonia will be necessary to confirm these results. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that mixed respiratory infections and IP-10 may play major, interconnected roles in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Clinically, assessment and monitoring of induced IP-10 serum level may assist clinicians to improve diagnosis and patient management of severe community-acquired pneumonia. Viral and bacterial strains. The 10 ng ml \\u22121 M-CSF (Miltenyi Biotec). THP\\u2212 1 MDMs were obtained by culturing cells with 10 ng ml -1 phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Invivogen, Toulouse, France) for 72 hours. Human airway epithelial cells (HAEC, bronchial cell type) originated from a 54-years old woman with no pathology reported (batch number MD056501) were provided by Mucilair (Epithelix, Geneva, Switzerland). Sterility, tissue integrity (TEER), mucus production and cilia beating frequency have been certified by the company. Gene expression profiling. Total cellular mRNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse-transcription of total mRNA was performed using the RT 2 First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Hilden, Germany). The expression of 84 genes involved in the human innate and adaptive immune responses was evaluated using the RT 2 profiler \\u2122 PCR Array (SABiosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The \\u0394 \\u0394 Ct method was applied to calculate the fold changes in gene expression for each gene relative to uninfected control cells using the web-based RT 2 profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software (SABiosciences). MicroRNA profiling array. Total cellular microRNAs were purified using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using the miScript Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). The profiling of 84 miRNAs was performed using the Human Immunopathology miScript miRNA PCR Array kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were analyzed using the miScript miRNA PCR array data analysis web portal. In silico miRNA target prediction. MiRNA target genes were retrieved and compiled using TargetScan 38 and microRNA.org resource 39 . The interactions between miRNAs and intracellular pathways were predicted using DIANA-miRPath v2.0 40 . THP-1 MDMs were seeded in 24-well plates (0.5 \\u00d7 10 6 per well) in triplicate, exposed to Influenza A H1N1 (A/Solomon islands/3/2006) virus (IAV) under serum-free conditions for 1 hour and then cultured for 3 hours in fresh RPMI-1640 containing 2% FBS. Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) serotype 14 was added at 4 hours after IAV infection. Gentamicin (10 \\u03bc g ml \\u22121 ) was added 2 hours after SP infection (i.e. 6 hours post-influenza infection) and maintained in the culture media throughout the experiment to kill extracellular bacteria and limit bacterial growth. Cell viability was determined by flow-cytometry using the FITC/Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. #4427975) . In this assay, fold changes have been defined by the \\u0394 \\u0394 Ct method using control RNU-44 and -48 as reference microRNAs. Total mRNA was purified from transfected and infected MDMs using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and specific primers were used to amplify transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGFB2; F: 5\\u2032 -CCATCCCGCCCACTTTCTAC-3\\u2032 , R: 5\\u2032 -AGCTCAATCCGTTGTTCAGGC-3\\u2032 ), SOCS6 (F: 5\\u2032 -AAGAATTCATCCCTTGGATTAGGTAAC-3\\u2032 , R: 5\\u2032 -CAGACTGGAGGTCGTGGAA-3\\u2032 ) 41 43 , and 3) absence of wheezing at auscultation, and, 4) first symptoms appearing within the last 14 days, and 5) radiological confirmation of pneumonia as per WHO guidelines 44 . Based on these primary criteria defining pneumonia cases, all 74 cases were retrospectively re-evaluated according to the WHO \\\"Pocket book of hospital care for children\\\" 45 criteria to evaluate pneumonia severity. Cases that died during the study, or who had at least one additional clinical signs including central cyanosis, dullness to percussion during chest examination, prostration/lethargy, pleural effusion observed on chest radiography were retrospectively included in the severe pneumonia group. Patients without any of these additional clinical signs were included in the non-severe pneumonia group. Table 4 . a IP-10 values are expressed in pg ml -1 . IP-10 concentration differences between groups were compared using unpaired Mann-Whitney tests; significant changes (P < 0.05) are in bold. Clinical and molecular analysis. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NAs) and whole blood samples were collected from children within 24 hours of admission. Whole blood samples were used for complete blood counts, blood culture and multiplex real-time PCR to identify Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B 46 . S. pneumoniae serotypes were defined using a 11 multiplex real-time PCR assay targeting the 40 most frequently represented serotypes or serogroups according to protocol developed by Messaoudi et al. 47 . Serum C-reactive protein (CRP; AssayPro, St. Charles, Missouri, United States) and Procalcitonin (PCT; VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S; bioM\\u00e9rieux) were quantified from whole-blood samples. Multiplex real-time non quantitative PCR (Fast-Track Diagnostic, Sliema, Malta) was used to detect 19 viruses and five bacteria in the respiratory specimens (NAs and pleural effusions). Mixed detection was defined as 1) PCR-positive for multiple viruses in NAs, 2) positive blood culture or PCR-positive for multiple bacteria in blood or 3) PCR-positive for one or multiple viruses in NAs and one or multiple bacteria in blood (identified by PCR and blood culture). Ethical approval. The study protocol, informed consent statement, clinical research form, any amendments and all other study documents were submitted to and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias de la Salud, the Universidad Nacional de Asunci\\u00f3n (IICS-UNA) and the Hospital Pedi\\u00e1trico Ni\\u00f1os de Acosta \\u00d1u. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in this study. The clinical investigation was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Statistical analysis. The Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare categorical variables; continuous variables and non-normally distributed data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test; normally distributed data were compared using unpaired t-tests. Comparative analyses between experimental conditions (i.e., MOCK, IAV, SP or IAV + SP) were performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test or Kruskal-Wallis analysis with Dunn's post-hoc tests. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off value for IP-10 to differentiate between non-severe and severe pneumonia cases. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, California, United States). \"], [\"Objective: To compare the burden of nosocomial and community-acquired respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) in adult and pediatric patients concomitantly admitted to a French tertiary hospital, \", \"Background.
